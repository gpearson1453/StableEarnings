Footnotes
RELUCTANT BRIDE lagged well back early, came four wide off the turn still with a lot to do, found her best stride into the final furlong and overhauled the
leaders from outside in the closing strides. FEELING FUNNY broke outward a bit, stalked the leaders three wide into the turn, dueled outside COIN THE
PHRASE through the stretch, finally edged past that one but was caught near the wire. COIN THE PHRASE vied outside PRINCESS CORO up the
backstretch, disposed of that one while being joined from the outside by FEELING FUNNY on the turn, battled with that one through the lane and yielded
late. AMERICAN GODDESS leaned in at the start pushing MAIZE N BLUE inward, advanced four wide coming off the turn, and finished willingly for a minor
share. SCREAMIN' BY settled in the middle of the field in the two-path, and failed to threaten in an even effort. PRETTY PLUM raced three wide and did not
become a factor. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY saved ground and failed to threaten. GHOSTING KIM broke slowly and was always outrun. PRINCESS CORO
hustled up inside to briefly vie with COIN THE PHRASE, lost ground to the leaders around the turn, and gave way through the stretch. MAIZE N BLUE got
pushed in at the start by AMERICAN GODDESS and was slow to begin, swung four wide off the turn, and got out steadily through the late stages to wind up
well past the middle of the course. TIME FOR FUN hopped slightly and broke out at the start, recovered to a forward position with aim outside the first flight
three wide, but gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAN GREYFROST raced five to four wide in the flight positioned off the top two leaders down the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the turn and
advanced three wide to take the lead near the five sixteenths pole, widened to a clear advantage upper stretch and held firm under steady urging.
MYSTERIO settled out of the gate then advanced and raced in the second flight going by the half mile marker, hustled up and headed in pursuit racing three
wide at the quarter pole, stayed on with response in stretch run, could not reach the winner but cleared second best. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) broke
readily and led the way out of the chute then came under pressure from LAWYER DRILL, vied for the lead positioned outside foe down the backstretch,
remained in striking distance entering the turn, failed to match strides past the midway point in the turn but stayed on with interest and secured show.
ORGANIC JENNY raced in range between foes in early stages then got shuffled back a bit and lost position late backstretch, hustled along through the turn,
raced six wide at the furlong marker and lacked the late needed response for late impact. LAWYER DRILL moved up the inside and challenged AMERICAN
RIVER for the lead in early stages, vied down the backstretch and held a slim lead entering the turn, was no match when the winner took the lead midway
around the turn then had nothing left in late reserve. ENKIDU raced in contention and tracked the top pair near the inside down the backstretch, failed to
sustain response moving through the turn and steadily faded. SKY POINT was not far off the pace in early stages then dropped out of contention, pulled up
nearing the wire then walked off.

MT. MITCHELL broke out bumping KEEP MARCHING into OLD NEWS, moved out of last advancing through the middle stages, came four wide into the
lane beginning to hit his best stride, and rallied steadily to wear down GAMBIT from outside a stride or two before the finish. GAMBIT prompted the early
pace outside, took over from SWEET GIANT after a half-mile and moved clear around the turn, fended off a challenge from VINESTONE through the furlong
grounds, but could not contain the winner. VINESTONE was forwardly placed early, moved off the inside chasing after GAMBIT three wide on the turn,
could not reach that one through the lane and weakened late. SWEET GIANT set the early pace inside, could not go with GAMBIT around the turn,
continued to lose ground through the lane but held for a minor share. STARSHIP FONZY had the two-path on the turn and could not reach contention.
KEEP MARCHING got bumped into OLD NEWS by the eventual winner at the break, raced three then four wide on the turn, and dropped far back. EZZY
BIG EZZY was finished after a half-mile two wide. OLD NEWS was bumped by KEEP MARCHING at the start, and dropped far back after six furlongs.
TRUMP'S KITTEN was always outrun.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND GLORY was off to a good start and raced near mid-range going by the wire for the first turn, rated off the top half of the field under a light rating,
picked up the pace entering the turn, edged up closer while confidently handled, tapped on the shoulder and shook the reins to go after MIMINA'S TEAM
upper stretch, advanced and raced near equal terms at the sixteenth pole then kicked clear. MIMINA'S TEAM cleared and and crossed over to the inside
after the start, matched strides for the lead racing inside of GOTTA GO MO around the first turn and into the backstretch then held a narrow lead and under
pressure, held the advantage and repelled bid around the far turn, came under attack from HIGHLAND GLORY in stretch run, dug in gamely but could not
kick on in final stages. CAT LADY raced in range and tracked the top two leaders down the backstretch, picked up the tempo near the three eighths pole
then shifted out wider for the drive, kept under steady urging and raced wide in late stages, stayed on with response and held off foe to take share.
SYLVANELLA was allowed to settle in early stages and raced off the pace down the backstretch, raced in two path entering the far turn then dropped to the
inside past the quarter pole, launched a bid turning for home and stayed on with interest but needed more for serious impact. THREE FLAMINGOS raced
along the outside off the early pace, picked up the tempo and gained position moving through the turn then got in tight and checked late turn then shifted out
wide upper stretch and improved without threatening. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT slightly hopped at the start, was unhurried and raced widest down the
backstretch, circled up closer racing five wide around the final turn then flattened out in the lane. JUSTLEAVEITALONE was off a step slow at the start then
remained reserved in the back down the backstretch, hustled up for response around the final turn then drifted in upper stretch, continued a bid up the inside
under strong left handed urging and failed to move on. GOTTA GO MO vied for the lead with rival around the first turn, continued to force the pace down the
backstretch, launched a bid for command around the final turn but could not move on and steadily faded. PLEASE raced in range and saved ground down
the backstretch then came up empty around the final turn. LETTER STORM raced in contention and tracked the pace down the backstretch then retreated
in the final turn. SCAPE saved ground racing near the rear in early stages and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
CHASE RUNNER vied inside KRACHENWAGEN for a quarter-mile before gaining command, rated along clear to the stretch, and dug in gamely to prevail.
THIRD ARMY lost his footing and steadied at the start, picked off rivals advancing rapidly four wide around the turn, had aim outside the leader through the
lane, but came up just short. ZIPPY had striking range from the start three wide, lodged a bid between horses through the furlong grounds, but weakened
from there. KRACHENWAGEN vied outside CHASE RUNNER before deferring up the backstretch, prompted the pace to midway on the far turn, and gave
way before completing six furlongs. COLIN A WINNER saved ground in range for a half-mile, and dropped back on the turn. SEEMEE was finished early
two wide.

Footnotes
DECLARATIONWARRIOR brushed with rival at the start then was forwardly positioned around the first turn, raced behind the pacesetter and stalked rival
two wide down the backstretch, headed in pursuit of DUCHESS OF SUSSEX around the turn and moved up to confront rival at head of the lane, raced near
equal terms for the lead at the furlong marker then wrested the advantage under strong handling and edged away. DUCHESS OF SUSSEX established the
lead out of the gate and angled to the inside, set the pace down the backstretch, continued with the advantage entering the far turn then took on the
challenge of DECLARATIONWARRIOR at the head of the lane, battled back for command past the furlong marker, could not match strides in final stages
but stayed clear for second best. PHILLY SPECIAL raced three wide in a forward position around the first turn then positioned in range off the early pace,
launched a bid entering the final turn, gained position then headed in pursuit for the top pair, could not gain on the top two leaders but stayed on under
steady pressure and edged out foe for share. TOMORRA was allowed to settle in early stages and raced two to three wide down the backstretch, picked up
the pace and hustled along two wide at the quarter pole, continued in steady pursuit and dueled for a share in stretch run but got edged out late for a
placing. UNFORESEEN raced three to four wide off the early pace, given cue and quickly advanced along the outside moving through the final turn then bid
flattened out upper stretch and finished evenly. CAMELLIA GAL was a bit anxious in the gate, brushed with foe at the start then settled off the pace in early
stages, launched a bid late far turn then moved out to race widest in the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. ONE TIME AROUND brushed
with foe at the start and came away near the back then dropped over to the inside, saved ground while unhurried down the backstretch, moved two wide
into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. VEER angled to the inside out of the gate and raced in the back through early stages, was put to a drive and
raced seven wide upper stretch and failed to move on. MARSH HARBOUR was forwardly placed around the first turn then tracked the top two leaders
racing near the inside, failed to sustain bid and gave way around the far turn. CAUSEWAY ROYCE was ridden along near midpack along the inside down
the backstretch then came up empty and faded in the final turn.

Footnotes
DALARNA broke to the lead, set a rapid pace along the inside, and was kept to pressure to remain well clear. TIL THE END saved ground throughout, and
finished gamely for the place while no menace to the winner. FLOWMOTION had the rail early, moved out four wide nearing the stretch, and was
outfinished for second. RIVER EVANGELIST raced three wide throughout, put in a mild run to get closest to DALARNA in mid stretch, but flattened out.
NATIONAL HONOR was far back to the stretch, and improved belatedly on the far outside. HOT AND HEAVY came under a ride three wide outside the
quarter-pole, and came up empty. CANDY CRUSHEM saved ground well back early, and made no impact. DEXTER ROAD was always outrun.
REMEMBER THE MAINE was finished early. THE QUEENS JULES chased outside the winner for six furlongs, and tired. FRONT LINE PAIGE was always
far back inside. REFLECTED STAR raced three wide and was no factor.

Footnotes
CABRE was ridden along and raced off the early pressured pace, prompted entering the turn and loomed up five wide near the quarter pole, turned for
home under a drive, advanced and took the lead from FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS mid-stretch and held well. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER lacked kick from the
gate and angled inside to save ground, continued to lack speed and raced in the back then hustled up and moved out late turn, was set down six to seven
wide for the drive, kicked in and rallied up to take place. FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS hustled up the rail in opening stages and dueled inside a trio of
pursuers, continued to battle and stayed inside of rivals around the turn, dug in gamely and shook free to a length on top upper stretch then got collared by
the winner past the furlong marker and got edged in final strides for place. FRANK ALONE vied three wide for the early lead, continued to battle three wide
between foes at the quarter pole, could not match strides top of the lane but remained in close pursuit at the furlong marker then flattened out. KILLA DEE
raced off the top pressured flight in early stages then launched a bid for command entering the turn, loomed up and vied four deep at the quarter pole, could
not match strides top of the lane then steadily weakened. STINK MAN was hustled up out of the gate and ridden along through early stages, was under a
ride racing two path around the turn then kept under pressure five wide in stretch run and lacked the needed response to threaten. SIGHTED raced widest
off the early speed, was ridden along the outside around the turn then raced wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. RAYO MY KING vied for the lead in
opening stages, continued to battle back two wide between foes at the quarter pole then tired in the drive. HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS switched inside to
save ground in early stages, hustled along the inside while not far off the pace around the turn then weakened in the lane. MISTER STORM vied briefly
along the outside for the lead then remained forwardly positioned and chased after the top flight late backstretch then failed to keep pace around the turn.

Footnotes
LARGENT led through the opening strides before deferring to EVERYONELOVESJAMES, tracked outside that one through a sharp six furlongs, took over
readily turning for home, and was ridden out to draw away. BOURBON IN MAY saved ground well back early, made up ground two wide around the far turn,
rallied between horses in upper stretch and finished willingly while no threat to his stablemate. KADAR hugged the rail on the turns, and offered a mild
response to land a share. EVERYONELOVESJAMES bumped with MANTRA at the start, took the lead from LARGENT first time under the wire, moved
inside setting a fast pace for six furlongs, proved no match in upper stretch and faded on the fence. CONVICTION TRADE saved ground early far back,
raced three then four wide around the far turn, angled widest in the stretch and gained only mildly. MANTRA got sandwiched at the start between JIMMY D
and EVERYONELOVESJAMES, and was never prominent. MOTATAABEQ was three wide into the backstretch in midpack, moved further out on the far
turn and could not gain. BELGRANO advanced three wide on the far turn, but could not sustain the rally and gave way. JIMMY D bumped solidly with
MANTRA at the start and was off slowly, steadied slightly soon afterward, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TALE OF SUCCESS hustled up out of the gate and advanced to vie for the lead positioned inside of DANCING DESTROYER, continued to match strides
around the turn then prompted turning for home and cleared on top at the head of the lane, continued a steady effort under right handed pressure in the
lane and kept clear. LET'S BE HONEST switched to the inside and moved up to join the second flight near the half mile marker, kept along with response
racing off the top pair around the turn, tipped out wider for the drive, could not reach TALE OF SUCCESS but produced a solid bid for second best.
DANCING DESTROYER was off to a good start and vied for the lead racing outside of TALE OF SUCCESS, continued to battle while hustled along around
the turn, could not match strides with the winner at head of the lane then gave way in the final furlong. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE lacked early foot and raced
off the pace, continued near the rear without response around the turn, shifted to the inside and put to a drive in stretch run, gathered momentum and
gained late. SAYONARA BABY hustled along and raced in range off the top two leaders, continued a bid off the top pair around the turn, moved into upper
stretch five wide then weakened. ROYAL MISTRESS was forwardly placed out of the gate and hustled along in steady pursuit, raced between foes in the
second flight at the half mile marker, flattened around the turn then offered no late run. DIENDA raced off the early pace, moved in and raced two wide
leaving the backstretch and failed to kick on under pressure around the turn. GLADITA showed early response and chased in contention then steadied near
the half mile marker and dropped back. AFROLINA raced along the inside, lacked early speed and had no response.

Footnotes
ELIZABETH WAY (IRE) saved ground trailing early, advanced around the far turn, swung to the three-path at the top of the lane, and rallied determinedly to
get past TAKE TEN and PARDON MY HEART from outside in the final strides. TAKE TEN settled in the middle of the pack early three wide, moved fast in
the four-path to grab the lead after six furlongs, fended off PARDON MY HEART through the furlong grounds but could not deny the top one late. PARDON
MY HEART rallied to contention four then three wide on the far turn, loomed boldly outside TAKE TEN through mid stretch, but did not have quite enough to
get by and weakened slightly near the finish. NORTH BROADWAY went along in the second flight for a half-mile, attempted to get through a tight space
between EMPIRE MOON and TAPIT TO RIDE midway on the far turn and appeared to push the latter out a bit, moved out to the five-path with a mild run
but flattened out near the eighth-pole. TAPIT TO RIDE lost some position in traffic heading into the far turn, appeared to get pushed out by NORTH
BROADWAY and bumped ELLE M'A SOURI just before completing six furlongs, and went evenly through the lane outside. IN FRONT was three wide early
near the back, moved farther out leaving the backstretch and lacked a solid response. PERFECT VIEW hustled up inside to get a short lead early, went
along through an even clip up the backstretch, could not cope with TAKE TEN and PARDON MY HEART after six furlongs, and gave way. TIZ ENOUGH
pressed the pace three wide, got bounced around and shuffled back badly between horses early on the far turn, and dropped far back. EMPIRE MOON
prompted the pace two wide between horses, and weakened before reaching the stretch. ELLE M'A SOURI (FR) saved ground early, found herself in heavy
congestion between horses heading into the far turn, appeared to absorb a solid bump from TAPIT TO RIDE just before completing six furlongs and lost the
rider, then was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN BEFORE THE RESULT
WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
