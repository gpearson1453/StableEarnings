Footnotes
WILD WINTER was settled outside a rival in the opening stages dropping off the second flight racing to the bend, angled sharply to the rail midway through
the turn while being prompted to advance, bid inside the leader nearing the furlong marker and edged that rival under firm right handed encouragement.
NICK THE CARDSHARK shifted at the start exchanging some contact with STEADY EARNER, was righted to track off the first flight along the inside racing
into the turn, came through when presented an opening in upper stretch to gain a brief advantage, shifted out leaving midstretch and just failed to contain
the winner. STEADY EARNER, exchanged bumps just after the start, was collected track off the second flight between foes, angled in nearing upper stretch
and made an effort to gain some position. PERFECT ANSWER was hustled to the lead along the inside racing through the backstretch, set the pace on a
clear margin racing into the turn, drifted well wide entering upper stretch losing momentum and soon gave way. EPIC DRAMA, urged to gain a position three
deep tracking the pacesetter racing into the turn, gave way in late stages. UNION GRACE settled in the last flight racing a bit off the inside, angled out five
wide entering the lane but had no rally. I AM TOO WILD broke readily to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, then gave
way between foes into the stretch.

Footnotes
CALL ME HANDSOME broke readily, moved clear while angling nearer to the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin in
hand racing to the turn, then was roused through the stretch to hold sway under right handed encouragement. BRANDT angled inwards to gain a position
tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in steady pursuit that foe but never gained even terms while proving best of the others. EARLY DELIGH, bumped
at the start, angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn but weakened in the closing stages. SUNSHINES OUT tracked off the
second flight three deep between rivals and continued evenly in that path into the stretch. FOUNTAINSTREETKID was settled in the last flight racing four
wide between foes on the backstretch and passed some tiring rivals in the closing stages. CIRCLE AWAY broke slowly, then was bumped from both sides,
settled along the inside, saved ground on the turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. NICOLE MUNNINGS broke outwards bumping
CIRCLE AWAY at the start, was righted to track off the second flight along the inside, shifted out nearing the turn and soon came up empty. FLASHTOUR,
caught five wide in early stages, soon retreated.

Footnotes
FORTLITE broke a step behind the leader when his head was turned slightly at the start, quickly recovered to gain a forward placing racing just outside the
pacesetter in the opening stages, prompted that rival racing into the turn, took over entering upper stretch and forged clear late under firm handling.
SHAKEM N BREAKEM bobbled at the start while breaking a bit slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, angled out four wide
racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others. INDIAN BUZZ tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside
racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. HE'S ON THE FLY tracked off the first flight
between foes racing into the turn but faded into the stretch. ACASEADAY popped through the gate just before the break, was urged to gain the lead while
angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled inside the eventual winner through the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. YADI, off a bit slowly when
his head was turned at the start, settled outside foes and never gained contention. ROSAS WAY broke awkwardly ducking inwards at the start while
appearing to make some contact with the assistant starter, then trailed the field throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START AND DECLARED ROSAS WAY A NON STARTER WITH ALL WAGERS CONNECTED TO THAT RUNNER BEING
REFUNDED.

Footnotes
R LOVELY JULZ broke sharply, angled in to dictate the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the turn, dueled inside foes through the turn,
shifted out in upper stretch and kicked away in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure. RITA OF CASCIA, bumped at the start, tracked the
pacesetter four wide in the opening stages, continued with a steady effort in that path racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. SIENA'S
TICKET, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, prompted the leader entering the bend, shifted to the inside while losing ground to the
pacesetter entering upper stretch and steadily faded in the closing stages. MALICED, urged along inside rivals tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the
turn, steadily faded into the stretch. RAINBOW RIVER, held up out of close quarters along the inside early, never gained contention. R D BLESSING broke
outwards bumping RITA OF CASCIA, was settled outside foes and never menaced thereafter. LADY MIDAS angled to the inside early and quickly dropped
out.

Footnotes
DAZZLING TRUTHS, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending the pace, was eased off the leaders racing into the backstretch, shifted out three
wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch, drifted out in the closing stages but
produced a steady late response to just prevail under firm right handed encouragement. ON A SPREE sped to the fore while angling to the rail, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch, edged forward between calls late and just failed to contain
the winner. EXCHEQUER, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to track just outside the leader, pressed
the issue between foes on the far turn to upper stretch but was just outkicked by the top pair late. PROFESSIONAL, pulling a bit between foes early, angled
to the inside to track just off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. JOHNNY
ACTION tracked off the second flight under light reserve along the inside racing to the far turn and continued evenly into the stretch. DARN THAT PARKER
settled last early, switched out entering the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and soon came up empty. LOCANO, reserved in hand
while switching to the outside on the first turn, was prompted to advance on the backstretch, lodged a brief, four wide bid racing into the far turn and quickly
came up empty. CAVE RUN settled three deep between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, offered no rally and was gathered up racing into the
stretch.

COLONELS DAUGHTER was reserved well off the leaders while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, advanced inside foes gaining position nearing the
far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under firm encouragement.
SUNDRENCHED, pulling a bit against rating in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch to track just off the second flight, made a
steady advance gaining position after a half, switched outside the leader to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, continued in a protracted skirmish
to late stages and just missed. NATIVE LION gained a forward placing along the rail stalking a rival's pace, advanced inside that foe to prompt the issue on
the backstretch, edged forward between calls racing into the far turn, dueled for command inside foes in a long drive past midstretch and was just headed
late in a game effort. MOONLIGHT RAIN tracked the leaders outside a rival, then three deep as part of the second flight racing to backstretch, was
prompted to advance while being fanned four wide on the far turn into upper stretch and finished evenly late. ANTALYA was settled outside foes racing to
the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. LUNA tracked off the second flight in the
opening half, was caught five wide racing into the far turn and had no rally. LADY BREXIT tracked off the first flight along the inside, then between foes into
the backstretch but faded early. WICKED FUN hopped at the start, was urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dueled between foes to
the second bend and gave way between foes into the far turn.

LAST PROMISE was urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the first turn, dictated terms on a narrow margin through the backstretch, edged away on
the far turn and held sway to the end under firm left handed pressure. ZITMAN, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages, was eased off the
leaders to track outside a rival in second flight, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to challenge but couldn't gain even terms
with the winner. DOUBLE DEEP angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed
late kick. SLICK AS ICE, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, couldn't match terms with that foe on the far turn and gave way into
the stretch. FUN PADDY settled last while angling inside early and soon dropped out. SACROMENTO Q and DEPUTY CZAR were each scratched at the
gate on the advice of the track veterinarian after the former became cast in the gate prior to the start.

Footnotes
ZEFIRO tracked just off the first flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted out three wide after a half, steadily advanced on the leaders in that path
racing into the far turn and went clear under firm encouragement. DOMAIN was settled along the rail, gradually gained position nearing the far turn, lost
some momentum when awaiting an opening entering the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then came through inside foes to edge a rival for the place
honors on the wire. GLOBAL ENTRY angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the leaders, saved ground into the second bend, swung out
four wide racing into upper stretch while being roused to advance and was just outkicked for second. HOPE AGAIN (GB) angled to the rail in early stages
tracking off the second flight, shifted out nearing the far turn, was steadied between foes entering the second bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch
and continued willingly between foes while just outkicked for a share. BOURBON EXTENSION, pulled his way to the lead while lugging inwards against
restraint racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn into
upper stretch and gave way. NAMARUNU (GER) settled last in the opening six furlongs and improved position inside foes in the closing stages while no real
threat. THE CURT FOX (GB) was settled outside foes tracking off the second flight, was fanned five wide midway through the far turn while being prompted
to advance, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch but soon came up empty. TOWN CLASSIC, urged to gain a forward placing three wide racing to the
backstretch, shifted inwards after a half to press the pace between foes into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. RUDIGER tracked the leaders
outside foes off the second flight in the opening half, shifted inwards racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance but proved empty in the drive.
SYCAMORE LANE was settled along the inside early and proved no threat. BURN THE BOATS, caught in close quarters between foes in early stages,
tracked off the second flight between foes, was steadied out of tight quarters entering the far turn and soon emptied out.

CULTURAL MANDATE broke readily to join the pace outside foes in the opening stages, forged clear racing into the turn, held sway on a comfortable
margin into upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under pressure. RAGTIME SUZY, came through close quarters at the break to gain
a position outside foes in the second, then made steady progress three deep between foes into the stretch to close the gap on the winner. MS. GENUINE
ducked out at the start, was settled off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the inside entering
the lane, angled to the rail in the closing stages and continued willingly to prevail for a share. RETURN THE FAVOR tracked off the second flight racing five
wide into the turn, then continued in that path through the closing stages to gain some position. BEACHTREASUREGIRL settled outside outside foes in the
last flight early, gained some position five wide between foes nearing upper stretch, was taken in hand avoiding close quarters, then altered course to race
six wide leaving midstretch but finished with interest. THEY CALL ME LUCKY, brushed at the start, tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, gained
some position three deep between foes into the lane but had no late kick. R D HAVE FAITH urged along between foes in second flight racing into the turn,
faded into the stretch. ANTHONY'S GIRL, bumped at the start, settled well back early, then displayed some belated interest between foes. MIA'S BOBTAIL
tracked off the second flight near the inside in the opening quarter, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch but faded between foes through the final
stages. RED KITTEN shied outwards at the start while bumping RAGTIME SUZY, was settled well back early, then was fanned seven wide into the stretch
while proving no real threat. COCKTAILS OR CANDY, urged along pursuing the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, steadied out of tight quarters
nearing upper stretch and quickly gave way. STERLING QUEEN flashed brief pace between foes racing to the turn and emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
CENTSLESS DRAMA broke readily, moved to the fore along the rail to dictate terms on a comfortable margin, then held sway into the stretch under firm
right handed pressure to prove best. ABILIFY, held up avoiding close quarters racing to the first turn while angling to the inside, tracked just off the
pacesetter into the far turn, shifted out while being roused to advance but was always only second best. BIG LIZ tracked off the second flight between foes
in the opening half, angled out four wide racing into the far turn and continued in that path to the end while continuing with interest to prevail for a share.
OBJECTIVE, pulling while a bit rank in the opening stages, shifted out to race between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, was eased back, then shifted
out three wide racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid but soon flattened out. CAPTUREMENOW settled between foes in early stages, angled out five
wide racing through late stages but made no real impression. TIZ HER WAY, caught four wide racing to the first turn, shifted inwards on the backstretch to
track the pacesetter between foes into the far turn but gave way into the stretch. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS angled to the rail early tracking off the second
flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no rally. RATTLE ROUSER settled outside foes early and failed to menace. BLUE INDY proved no factor.
