Footnotes
WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG dropped back after the start then settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the whip,
moved out at the three-sixteenths, shifted further out near the eighth-pole, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to get up late. BROADWAY
JONES showed good speed, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, took a narrow
advantage past the eighth-pole, dueled with AW ITE into the final sixteenth while rubbing saddles with that foe, narrowly got the best of that foe for the place
but was caught by the winner. AW ITE showed good speed on the outside, moved clear leaving the backstretch, controlled the action along the rail on the
turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under a drive while under attack from the runner-up in upper stretch, dueled with that foe while brushing into the
final sixteenth and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. GEM OF CARLOS settled off the pace, was urged along while two to three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and finished well to just miss the trifecta.
GENTLEMAN CHARLIE was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the turn and lacked the needed response.
BETTIN ON BRYAN was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to respond. BIG BOSS
MAN settled off the pace, was urged along while four then five wide on the turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
OVERZEALOUS tracked the leading group under a hold saving ground through the first turn, edged closer still in behind along the rail into the far turn,
began to move out past the five-sixteenths coming three wide to the head of the lane and under urging, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch, was kept to
task late to hold sway. BLUE STEEL moved in heading to the first turn to press inside runners through that bend, applied further pressure into the far turn
taking a narrow lead midway on that bend, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on gamely under steady urging to maintain the place. RESILIENT RICK
settled last but one racing off the inside in the two to three path early, was still far back but beginning to pick it up under some encouragement three then
four wide on the far turn, swung eight deep into upper stretch, gained steadily but was too late. SENOR BLANCO tucked in while forwardly-placed tracking
in behind the leading trio from the three path through the first turn, was joined by inside and outside foes into the far turn continuing three wide and between
runners on that bend while asked for a little bit more midway, continued evenly in the stretch but ultimately needed more. BRIAR JUMPER broke just a
half-step slowly and was unhurried early bringing up the rear while switching out to the two then three path on the first turn, continued to trail up the
backstretch still removed from the rail going in about the same path through the far turn, angled nine wide at the top of the stretch then ran on mildly.
VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) was under a hold mid-pack racing two to three wide in the early going and a tad keen to go on, continued outside foes up the
backstretch going four then five deep on the far turn, was asked to pick it up having shifted seven wide into upper stretch but failed to produce a rally.
GUSTNADO was encouraged at the break but lacking speed, shifted in and saved ground along the rail in the back-half of the field on the first turn,
continued inside on the far turn and was asked for more past the five-sixteenths but was never near enough to threaten. MR. PAPILLON was in just a bit
tight and slightly taken up at the start, moved in to the three path settling in the rear echelon into the first turn, edged a bit closer from outside heading up the
backstretch toward the far turn, went two to three wide and between runners through part of that bend, asked for more but failed to produce a bid.
FLEETWAY broke inwardly, prompted the pace from between runners heading into the first turn going three wide on that bend, continued to force the issue
outside the runner-up heading up the backstretch, began to weaken on the far turn and faded in the stretch. HERECOMESYOURMAN was in close outside
runners four wide pressing the pace into the first turn, lost some ground but was still in pursuit outside heading to the far turn, dropped back between
runners four wide on that bend and was empty for the drive. FINAL TIME WAS AMMENDED FROM THAT POSTED ON THE VIDEO BUT WAS
COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY. (Rail at 18 feet)

Footnotes
FORT POLK went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along while three wide on the far turn, shifted five wide at the top of the
stretch, rallied to the lead near the three-sixteenths then quickly shook clear and drew away under strong urging. SNOWBALL broke a step slow, saved
ground on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, moved out leaving the backstretch, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, shifted
six wide while off the heels of the winner into the stretch, pursued that foe under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place.
SAY YES AGAIN went to the front, set the pace in the two path under a snug hold, was asked while being headed just after turning into the stretch and tired
while clear for the show. SETHAMEE STREET shifted three wide from the inside early on the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside, chased in the
three path on the far turn, took the lead just inside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths, dropped back under a
drive into the final furlong and faltered then was dismounted a sixteenth after the finish before being vanned off while reported to have tied up. BELLA
CAJUN went three then two wide on the first turn, settled in a good position, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was ridden along while inside to the two
path on the far turn and failed to respond. CRISPY CREED went four wide under a tight hold on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside for a
half-mile then retreated.

AWESOME ONE received just mild coaxing from the start and moved forward to set the tempo racing off the fence but shifting in to the two path heading to
the first turn, moved in further on that bend to dictate terms from inside up the backstretch, was challenged by outside rivals late on the far turn, dispatched
those runners to edge clear again into upper stretch, held sway determinedly under steady handling. EKATI PEACE broke awkwardly but quickly recovered
to track inside, fought restraint in the early going then steadied entering the first turn, settled down to track the aforementioned from inside up the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn coming out a path or so leaving that bend with aim on the winner but could make no headway while clear of the
others. ZURLIN settled into stride outside rivals toward the rear three deep into the first turn, advanced three to four wide into and on the far turn coming five
wide out of that bend, ran on in the stretch under urging to hold the photo for show over FRESHMAN CLASS, who was in a bit tight and forced in soon after
the break, taken a hold of and raced unhurriedly inside a rival but just off the fence into the first turn and up the backstretch, still raced well back on the far
turn going in the two then three then four path on that bend, was six wide in upper stretch and gained steadily but too late. JOYFUL CAT came in shortly
after the break and was keen to run on between runners but taken strongly in hand early, eased back entering the first turn and switched outside a foe going
three to four wide through that bend, edged closer outside rivals four wide to make a mild bid late on the far turn but lacked the needed late kick for the lane.
HEAVENLY SIS was forwardly-placed outside runners heading to the first turn, went three wide on that bend stalking the eventual winner, made a mild brief
bid between foes still three wide late on the far turn and lacked a late kick in the lane. LIVY B was taken up shortly after the start when in tight along the rail
early, saved grounds through both turns but was never near enough to threaten. EVERY SINGLE DAY raced well off the inside in the four path through the
early going mid-pack, edged a little closer up the backstretch into the far turn going two to three wide between runners on that bend and coming out four
wide by the top of the stretch, angled in a bit in mid-stretch and was not a threat. GOLDEN LOCH was taken up soon after the start dropping back to last as
rivals came in, raced off the fence in the three path trailing the field through the first turn, was still last going four to five wide on the far turn and seven deep
into upper stretch where she came up empty. (Rail at 18 feet)

the final sixteenth and got up late under strong urging. BOLD REY set the pace on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, shook off C
ISLANDSURPRISE in upper stretch, led under the whip until the final strides but was caught while clear for the place. TAKE CHARGE GAL broke out at the
start, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside under some restraint, ranged up four then three wide on the far turn, made a
brief bid near the five-sixteenths, dropped back four wide under a drive into upper stretch and was outfinished while just able to get the show. LADY BLUE
saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, raced in the two path early on the far turn, shifted four wide nearing the five-sixteenths then was
roused, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. C ISLANDSURPRISE went around the first turn in the two
path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid between horses under urging in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch then lost
touch with the winner, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SUNDEREYA broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was ridden along while four then three wide on the far turn, dropped to the two path under a drive at the quarter-pole and failed to rally. KATIE THE
CUTIE was last to commence, went three wide on the first turn, became rank under restraint and was taken up some on that bend, was reserved off the
pace then roused leaving the backstretch, went five wide under urging on the far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and came up empty. BAYLOR
went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, moved up to make a bid with a half-mile to run, came up empty early on the far turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
LAWTON settled into stride racing outside a foe well back of the leaders into the turn, given mild encouragement four wide on that bend and strong urging in
upper stretch, struck the lead by the furlong marker and moved clear then held safe late. AFLEET ASCENT was taken up at the start as rivals came in,
shifted in at that juncture, was inside a foe just off the fence at the rear entering the turn, gradually came out three then four deep on that bend eventually
swinging to the seven path and widest of all by the top of the stretch, rallied willingly to get the place. DUNCASTLE got away well and pressed inside a rival
early then continued to chase but switching outside that one early on the first turn, went two wide on that bend, was outkicked in the lane. IRISH
HEATWAVE broke inwardly but moved forward outside DUNCASTLE to set the pace up the backstretch, shifted in entering the turn while in the clear, was
challenged by outside rivals in upper stretch and weakened thereafter. LUNA DE LOCO shifted in heading up the backstretch, came out approaching the
turn, encouraged along three wide through that bend but had no late kick in the lane. VIVID VERSE chased from between rivals three wide on the turn and
failed to rally. ROMAN CREED was well-placed inside mid-pack then steadied midway up the backstretch losing about two lengths in the process, regained
momentum still inside then was getting out a bit into the turn, was never near enough to threaten. ONE MEAN MAN trailed early while outside a rival, trailed
into the turn going in the three to four path on that bend and shifting six wide near the quarter pole, was never a threat. DON'TASK DON'TTELL broke
inwardly, chased from outside foes four wide on the turn coming six wide into upper stretch then faded. (Rail at 18 feet)

NINETY ONE ASSAULT moved in early, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, raced four wide on the far turn, was roused
just inside the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to
make a bid inside the furlong marker, battled with the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under steady handling. HONOVI saved ground on the first turn,
settled in the back half of the field, was roused while dropping from the two path to the rail on the far turn, rallied inside in upper stretch, closed well to make
a bid inside the furlong marker, battled with the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the place. ZERO GRAVITY went around the first turn in the two
path, settled well back in the field, went three then two wide on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, steadied behind horses inside the
three-sixteenths, moved out into the final furlong and improved position to get the show. MARQUEE PRINCE went three wide on the first turn, settled in the
front half of the field on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong,
lost the advantage shortly thereafter and weakened. SAY THE WORD went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three
wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. NICE
NOT NICE rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in the middle of the field, went around the far turn in the two path, came under a drive into upper
stretch, gained past the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and also weakened. SONNETEER was off about two lengths slow, went four to five
wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EZMOSH went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, inherited
the lead when the pacesetter dropped back abruptly inside the seven-sixteenths, moved from the two path to the rail while clear on the far turn, lost the
advantage under a drive in upper stretch and tired. CLINT MAROON (GB) traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged
along while two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MAJESTIC PRIDE set the pace on the inside, fell back
abruptly inside the seven-sixteenths and was pulled up then vanned off. (Rail at 18 Feet) MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
MONARCHOS PRAYER chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, tipped three then four wide into upper stretch, took the lead nearing the
furlong marker, shook clear inside that marker and held under steady urging. DAYLIGHT DEELITE was urged along towards the rear, raced inside to the
two path on the turn, gained under the whip in upper stretch, moved out while closing in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. JADED ROSE
was coaxed along on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while just able to get
the show. CHERRY TWIST pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the
final furlong and weakened then just missed the show. D'FREAK NASTY was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. SAINTS' GIRL dropped back early then was urged along towards the rear, went five wide on the turn
and failed to threaten. CARSON'S PROSPECT lacked speed while urged along, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. STELLA'S
SURPRISE set the pace under pressure from her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead near the
three-sixteenths, dropped back inside the furlong marker and gave way. COHENSCOLLEGEFUND settled towards the front of the field, chased three to four
wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faltered.
