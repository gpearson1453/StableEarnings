came three wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. MULHIMA (IRE) crossed to the inside and saved ground chasing the
pace, came out into the stretch and also could not quite offer the necessary late response. COLDWATER settled inside then outside a rival, came out into
the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SEASIDE DANCER prompted the pace outside a rival then stalked just off the rail and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TEXAS WEDGE steadied between horses midway on the backstretch then stalked between foes, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch, came out in
upper stretch, rallied under urging to the front three wide in deep stretch and held gamely. DOUBLE TOUCH (GB) broke a bit slowly, chased outside a rival
then between horses leaving the backstretch and on the turn, came out into the stretch and finished well. BAY MUZIK sped to the early lead and angled in,
set the pace inside, fought back along the rail in deep stretch and held third. BLITZKRIEG stalked the pace off the rail, went between foes on the turn, came
out into the stretch and rallied between horses late. CAPTAIN SCOTTY stalked just off the rail to the stretch, bid between horses past midstretch and
continued willingly but was outfinished. GRINNING TIGER pulled and saved ground stalking the pace, drifted out a bit in midstretch then drifted in some late
and also was outfinished. TRIBALIST broke slowly then chased inside, came out into the stretch, steadied off heels in midstretch, angled in late and could
not quite offer the necessary response. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) bobbled at the start, stalked three deep to the stretch and also lacked the needed late kick.
LEGENDS OF WAR broke a bit slowly, chased off the rail then three deep into and on the turn, was four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
CARNIVOROUS chased outside then three deep on the turn and four wide into the stretch and did not rally, then was unsaddled on the clubhouse turn and
vanned off. A claim of foul by the rider of TRIBALIST against GRINNING TIGER for alleged interference in midstretch was not allowed by the stewards, who
ruled the incident did not alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
MUSAWAAT (GB) saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the second turn then steadied while being fanned out into the stretch but gained the
lead, drifted in and battled outside a rival in midstretch and held on gamely under urging. SOUTHERN KING chased outside then three deep on the second
turn, came out four wide into the stretch and steadied when crowded in upper stretch, angled in and bid three wide in deep stretch and continued willingly.
FARQUHAR stalked a bit off the rail then between horses into the second turn, angled to the inside into the stretch, bid along the fence in midstretch and
just held third. RED KING bumped at the start, angled in and chased inside then outside a rival on the second turn, came out some in the stretch, was
crowded in upper stretch and edged for the show. CRYSTAL TRIBE (IRE) stalked outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch, was fanned out four
wide in upper stretch, continued between foes in the drive and was outfinished. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) pulled between horses then chased between
foes, found the inside on the second turn, came out past the eighth pole and put in a late bid between foes. SHINING THROUGH chased between horses
then a bit off the rail leaving the second turn and in the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. M TOWN GEM stalked three deep, came
four wide into the stretch and lacked the necessary response. SOBERANO (FR) saved ground off the pace, continued inside into the stretch and did not
rally. REAL MASTER (FR) four wide into the first turn, chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail leaving the second turn, came out and steadied when
crowded in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GOLDEN BIRTHDAY sped to the early lead and angled in, set the pace along the inside, inched
away again on the second turn, took a bad step then drifted out while being pulled up into the stretch with an injury behind, then lost the rider and was
vanned off.
