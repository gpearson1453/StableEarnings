Footnotes
SWISS SUNRISE rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and was steadily encouraged to keep HE'S A GOLD DIGGER at
bay, who was shuffled back leaving the gate and settled off the pace, started a bid from the three eighths pole, improved off the rail rounding the far turn,
closed to the girth of the winner in deep stretch but hung through the final yards. WINNING SCHOLAR settled off the early pace inside then steadied at the
rail entering the backstretch, recovered stride nearing the seven sixteenths pole but steadied again at the rail past the five sixteenths and showed little more
while passing fading rivals. FRATHOUSE MUSIC settled close through the opening turn and stalked the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three
eighths pole but had little left leaving the far turn. TURNER ASHBY stalked the pace two deep the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn in the five path but showed little more. RIGHTEOUS MAN raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and entered
the backstretch outside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY SONG accelerated to the lead leaving the three eighths pole and rated the pace, dueled with the advantage at the rail on the turn and dug in
under steady encouragement to hold on well. SHACKLED was jostled early then hustled to contention to pressure the pace two deep and between horses,
continued close through the turn but dropped back into the lane and couldn't improve. QUICKHATCH broke a step slow then angled out to give chase,
rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly. FASTER THAN CHROME gave chase toward mid track then raced off the rail on the turn, drifted
to the four path leaving the turn and showed little further. STERLING REBEL was jostled then pinched back early on, raced well off the pace inside and
never factored. RHINESTONE COWBOY pressured the early pace three wide but dropped back toward the quarter pole, drifted through the turn then
weakened. BEDTIME FOR BONZO gave close early chase then faded in the five path of the turn. Per Stewards ruling #15, Gostly Song has been
disqualified from earnings.

ZIPPY JO gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the three path, drifted a bit leaving the turn but dug in under steady handling to get
up later yards, and was clear under the wire. LOVE YOU GOODBYE was hustled up to set a pressured pace, contested the rail through the turn and drew
clear midway on the turn but was caught flattening stride later yards. DAJEM gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn off the rail, angled
five wide into the lane, closed well to take third later yards and was gaining on the waning pace-setter. TRACI'S GIRL pressured the pace at near even
terms but dropped back midway on the turn and flattened stride in the lane. FIDES RATIO (FR) gave chase toward the outside then raced in the five path of
the turn, was carried out entering the stretch then finished evenly while lugging in. J C THE DESTROYER gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn
then weakened. VENETIAN DRIVE came away a bit rank then settled back off the rail, started a bid past the quarter pole, left the turn in the six path then
lugged in under right hand encouragement.

Footnotes
LOU'S CHARDONNAY took over leaving the chute and set a clear, well reserved pace, was asked entering the stretch and steadily encouraged to late
stretch before being taken in hand. MISS TSCHETTER gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail and had to settle for second best. RIVETER GLORIA
gave chase off the rail then eased to the four path rounding the turn and was along to take third later yards. ROCKET BID gave chase inside, rounded the
turn off the rail and showed little more. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT chased the pace from the four and five paths then weakened leaving the turn. DIMITRI'S
ROMANCE chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn in the six path and had little left. TOTO'S DARLING became edgy in the gate and,
consequently, was unprepared for the start, broke in the air, gave chase outside then saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
COLLEGE KID accelerated to the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the turn,
dueled clear inside the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. IRISH KNOCKOUT pressured the pace at near even terms and dueled at a
close disadvantage two deep rounding the turn, but, dropped back at the eighth pole and couldn't improve while finishing evenly. CHEESE LOUISE gave
chase, raced in the three path of the turn then dueled through the lane for third. IT'SMYINTENSION chased the pace and rounded the turn in the six path,
finished well widest and just missed third. THREE BOPS chased the pace inside then eased to the six path rounding the turn and flattened stride later yards.
RUSH EXPRESS raced at the rail rounding the turn then weakened. KATALIMA hesitated at the break and raced well back. COPELANQUIKZIP ran loose
in the post parade and became edgy in the gate, was only briefly close, showed no early response to steady encouragement and was taken in hand.

Footnotes
CHARITABLE ROSE stalked the pace from the three path then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the
far turn, contested even terms through the upper stretch, took the nod mid-stretch then held on. SWEET BAYTOWN settled off the pace in the two and three
paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the three path, dug in to take second the final yards and was gaining on the
winner. SHE'S A LIL PISTIL rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
continued at even terms through the upper stretch but gave up the nod mid-stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth. MORNINGAFTERBLUES saved
ground off the pace, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. THERE GOES MY GIRL raced in the
five path on the turns and settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path of the final turn. WON
LIL INDIAN stalked the pace from the seven eighths pole, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths then weakened in the five path of the far turn. SECRET
ALCHEMY raced off the pace and entered the backstretch outside and was never a factor.

AUSSIE GOLD rated a clear pace inside, was pressured into the far turn then steadily urged through the lane to hold on well. AMANDA LANE stalked the
pace off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but proved no match. LIES AND SCANDALS broke in to make contact with Mackenzie's
Star then settled close to the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled out leaving the turn but flattened stride.
CAMERON STREET was bumped at the break then saved ground, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, angled widest leaving the far turn and
showed little further. JET SETTIN LADY settled just off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the
far turn then weakened. FLATTER ME OWEN saved ground while racing well back. MACKENZIE'S STAR was bumped inward and into Cameron Street
leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LADY MADISON stalked the pace from the two and three paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths, raced clear
midway on the far turn and held well under steady stretch encouragement. CAROLINA BAMBINA settled close toward the inside the first turn then bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed for second midway on the far turn then couldn't improve further. PRISS saved ground off the pace the first turn
then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but showed little more.
INSIDIOUS CAT saved ground off the pace, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened stride while passing
fading rivals. BELLE NATION raced in the four and five paths the first turn then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, but, flattened out in the
three path of the far turn. DEREK'S COP E CAT raced in the four path the first turn then entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole than angled outward leaving the far turn. VINTAGE GIN broke outward then corrected course to the inside and rated the pace, was pressured leaving
the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths then faded at the rail rounding the far turn. WITCHY WINDSOR raced in the four path the
first turn then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. FATAL FLASHBACK was never a
factor.
