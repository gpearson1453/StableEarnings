SAMADI SKY, inside, took the lead near quarter pole, drew off to a long lead mid stretch and was fully extended to the end. R JOLLEY DREAMER saved
ground just off pace, eased out and gained place. LUNAR ROVER steadied after the start, raced very wide and passed faders. MY PIRATE also steadied
after the start and raced wide and failed to menace. CAPE MAY FERRY vied for command outside winner then tired. HATTERAS BOUND, between foes,
failed to menace. POLISHED STEEL raced wide and dropped back steadily. ONLY THE TRUTH, in the three path while just off the pace, tired. VERY
COLORFUL was in the four path and just off the pace, drifted out and tired. THE MONEY TRAIN, very wide, failed to menace.

rallied outside of WE B JAMMIN, quickly took charge, dug in gamely, then was no match for the winner. DIRT IN YOUR FACE raced three wide early,
chased between rivals, came two wide into the lane, lacked a rally and bested the others for the show spot. DIAMOND SETTER raced off the pace inside
and failed to respond. MASONS TURN raced four wide early, chased four wide on the backside and faded. WE B JAMMIN set the pace racing in the two
path, dueled briefly and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
TAP THE MARK between foes early, raced in traffic on the final turn, eased out entering the stretch then quickly angled in and was up in the final strides.
RISQUE REBEL set the pace three path, came out under left handed pressure near mid stretch and brushed TRUE BLUE lightly, was brushed by that same
rival in deep stretch and was outfinished. TRUE BLUE saved ground just off pace, eased out entering the stretch, was brushed lightly by RISQUE REBEL
mid stretch then drifted in and brushed same rival and finished gamely. IN EQUALITY, racing just off the rail and just off the pace, drifted out and faded.
MIAMI TIGER, outside and just off the pace, faded late. ECLIPSED MOON, wide and never far back, tired. HALITE, out from the rail, split rivals on the final
turn then gave way. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF TRUE BLUE AGAINST RISQUE REBEL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH
WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

Footnotes
SUNDAY INN dueled between rivals for the early lead, battled on the turn, dueled with TIZ GRACIE past midstretch and wore down that rival to prevail. TIZ
GRACIE dueled inside for the lead, battled on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. LADY LUCY LU chased four wide,
rallied four wide into the lane, bid and was outkicked. BELLA G stumbled at the start, chased inside and rallied mildly inside in the stretch. CRAZY BEA
chased three wide, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ARTEMIS RISING away alertly, dueled three wide for the lead, dueled outside rivals on
the turn and tired. TRIPLE JUMP chased between rivals and faded. IT'S SO EASY stumbled badly at the start and was outrun.

stretch and was gaining. WHITE BLUFF, well placed between foes, finished willingly. TRULY A MOON SHOT saved ground just off the pace, ducked out
near mid stretch then tired. SUNSHINE SPERRY broke slowly, saved ground and passed faders. CHASING MY HALO moved out to the four path and
raced just off the pace, was fanned wider stretch and gave way. RYDELL broke slowly, raced between foes and never threatened. PEGASUS RED, very
wide, failed to menace. SMART AND TOUGH prompted outside winner then tired. FINAL RITUAL had only brief speed.
