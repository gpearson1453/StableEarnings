Footnotes
LA CARA BONITA contested the early pace inside, shook free into the stretch, and remained in command under pressure. OUR FANTASY trailed well back
for three furlongs, swung to the far outside at the top of the stretch, and was along for the place. SHOUG had aim outside the leaders three wide past the
quarter-pole, rallied into second entering the final furlong, but was outfinished for that spot. ROYAL MEGHAN raced between horses in the two-path on the
turn, and gained mildly late. LIVIN AT THE BEACH was behind horses around the turn, came clear being asked three wide into the lane, and was
one-paced to the finish. SAUCY TUNE checked sharply along the rail heading into the turn, and made no late headway mildly urged. ROMANTIC TALE
argued the pace outside the winner through the turn, and gave way in the stretch. IM THIRSTY TOO pressed the early pace between horses, and faded
steadily leaving the turn. TARA tired three wide before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAY BEAU shifted to the outside position in opening stages and advanced to race in range of the early leaders, hustled up entering the turn, continued a
steady outside bid under pressure into the lane, gained the advantage with a furlong left to run then finished going away. FIRST AND THREE was forwardly
placed down the backstretch, advanced to challenge KYLE for the lead near the three eighths pole, continued to battle for the lead upper stretch then failed
to be a match when the winner took control. UNDAUNTED raced off the early speed then hustled up to pick up the pace late backstretch, kept under steady
urging around the turn and into stretch run and churned on to finish on equal terms for show. BIG BOY BRUNO settled in early stages never too far off the
early speed, remained patiently handled and raced in two path at the quarter pole then shifted out wider turning for home, continued a steady outside bid
and finished on equal terms for show. KYLE set the pace through early stages then vied for the lead with FAST AND THREE near the three eighths pole,
continued to match strides at head of the lane, was no match when the winner took command then faded in the final furlong. TOTONO was forwardly placed
down the backstretch then failed to keep pace and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
KING OF RANCH broke to the lead, rated along through even fractions a bit off the rail, was under a mild drive through the furlong grounds and coasted in
unchallenged. LOVEDISC was outside HERO UP approaching the first turn and got bumped by that rival, moved to the rail soon after that, and rallied to
best the others while never able to threaten the top one. BACANO saved ground outrun early, swung four wide off the far turn and failed to menace. STILL
SCHEMIN broke outward in tandem with FRIO and was off last, raced three wide for six furlongs, came four wide off the far turn, lugged in through upper
stretch having to be forcefully corrected, then steadied behind HERO UP in deep stretch. FAYEZ bounced off the left side of the gate at the start, got forced
out outside HERO UP and LOVEDISC entering the first turn, and never reached contention. HERO UP bumped with BAMBINO at the start, moved out for
room bumping LOVEDISC into the first turn, prompted the pace outside KING OF RANCH and tired in the stretch. BAMBINO bumped with HERO UP at the
start, saved ground and had no response when put to a drive entering the far turn. FRIO advanced to contention three wide after a half-mile, could not
sustain the rally through the far turn, and faltered through the drive. JEFE GRANDE was pushed out and steadied at the start, trailed to the lane and was not
pressured to keep up.

Footnotes
BAZOO was off to a good start and raced in tracking position through early stages, picked up the pace near the half mile marker and advanced to race
behind the leader, was set down for the drive three wide at head of the lane, continued to chip away on the leader and drew clear late under firm handling.
BLACK HOPE sped to the lead and held a narrow margin over POWER PUNCH in opening stages then cleared on top, held firm around the turn then
turned for home two wide while put to a drive, stayed on with response then lacked a closing kick and got outfinished for the win. POWER PUNCH raced
just off the leader in opening stages and remained in pursuit around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and continued a bid up the inside with a
furlong left to run then quickly faded in late stages and was vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
HURRICANE BREEZE tracked the leaders for six furlongs, rallied three wide into the stretch, wrested command outside approaching the eighth-pole and
drove clear. LEMON DROP TINI raced two wide for six furlongs, swung out wider into the lane, and rallied steadily outside rivals to get up for second.
ELUSIVE MOLLY was mostly three wide on the turns, moved further out into the stretch and rallied willingly between horses. WICKED MERCURY bumped
with TAPPED TWICE at the start, saved ground on the turns, bid between horses in upper stretch, moved back to the rail leaving the furlong marker and
was outfinished. MIDNIGHT BELLA raced three to four wide around the far turn, and passed tired horses outside. TAPPED TWICE bumped with WICKED
MERCURY at the start, hugged the rail on the turns, was bottled up behind horses in upper stretch, and did not have enough when clear. KISSES FOR
TIZZY reared at the start and was off slowly, trailed for six furlongs, and improved late while never a factor. MONEY NEVER SLEEPS was always outrun.
CHOUCHOU DE BOO pressed the pace outside MISS OVER THERE for six furlongs, and gave way through the lane. MISS OVER THERE set the pace
inside, and faltered approaching the eighth-pole. RHYTHM TREE raced three wide and was finished early.

Footnotes
KORCZAK matched strides for the lead coming out of the chute then cleared on top, continued to save ground and remained comfortable still unleashed
moving through the turn, shook the reins at head of the lane, responded willingly and drew off while ridden out. STARSHIP FONZY raced off the pace near
the inside down the backstretch, angled out and hustled up moving through the far turn, kept on with response five wide into the lane and finished clearly
second best. SWEET GIANT bumped the side of the gate then moved out to race widest while rated off the early speed, urged to pick up the pace past the
half mile marker, continued a wide bid through the lane and gained share. EZZY BIG EZZY stalked down the backstretch then launched a bid for command
around the turn, stayed on three wide entering top stretch then weakened in the final furlong. TRUMP'S KITTEN raced in range through early stages, was
ridden along to maintain tempo leaving the backstretch, kept under steady pressure into the lane but lacked the needed response for late impact. BRAVELY
BOLD rated four wide off the early pace then switched in a couple paths late backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, briefly gained position
then failed to keep pace and faded in the lane. MANO raced in the back and tapped on the shoulder to pick up the pace midway through the backstretch but
lacked response, entered top stretch three wide and offered no late rally. OLD NEWS was forwardly placed in early going then retreated after the half.

Footnotes
RISING BELLA was unhurried early near the inside, moved out three wide rallying into the stretch, overtook YOLANDA'S PRIDE from outside entering the
final furlong and drove clear. YOLANDA'S PRIDE quickly gained command, rated along inside for six furlongs, entered the lane in the two-path, and was no
match for the top one while drifting out through the furlong grounds. LITTLE BIT GOOD became restless in the gate, saved ground well in range to the
stretch, and lacked the needed late bid. PATTY HEANEY was a bit keen prompting the pace outside YOLANDA'S PRIDE, and weakened after six furlongs.
DONDER 'N BLITZEN raced three wide on the turns, and faded in the stretch. BABYBEL raced in the two-path on the turns, and was never a factor. I'M
THAT BIRD was finished early inside.

Footnotes
ITSENOUGH raced four wide off the top trio through early stages, prompted and advanced to gain the position behind the leader moving through the turn,
gained striking distance on NITE BRITE near the furlong marker then dug in determinedly under firm handling and edged away. NITE BRITE sped to the
lead at the start and continued to lead the way with ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA not far behind, moved away from rival and held a clear advantage then
ITSENOUGH began to loom a threat leaving the turn, dug in on top and held a narrow lead with a furlong left to run then got wore down in final stages.
NAPA RULES raced off the top two leaders through the backstretch, was ridden along to maintain tempo around the turn then stayed on with response
through the lane and cleared share. GRAN BRANDY raced in the back through early stages, hustled along two wide around the turn, continued a steady bid
near the inside upper stretch then lacked the late needed response for impact. WORDS OF DEVINE broke outward at the start, raced five wide off the early
pace, was put to pressure along the outside around the turn, stayed outside entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA was
forwardly placed out of the gate and chased after NITE BRITE through the backstretch, lost position around the turn then had nothing left in late reserve.

PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY bobbled at the start, dueled for command outside FIGHTRESS to midstretch, and edged away under a drive through the last
sixteenth of a mile. DREAMS ARE MADE bumped with MISS MIAMI at the start, advanced along the inside around the turn, rallied in the two-path through
the lane and was up for the place. AWSUM ROAR settled in the middle of the field early, swung four wide off the turn with aim outside the leaders, and just
missed second. MISS MIAMI was bumped between horses at the start, raced well back two wide to the top of the lane, moved out a bit farther and offered a
mild response to get a minor share. FIGHTRESS bumped with MISS MIAMI at the start, dueled for the lead inside the eventual winner, and gave way
entering the last furlong. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT broke slowly, trailed inside to the quarter-pole, angled to the far outside and made little headway. LILA RUTH
tracked outside the battling leaders for three-eighths of a mile, and faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
GABY'S DREAM raced in tracking mode and saved ground down the backstretch, launched a bid along the rail around the far turn, prompted left handed
turning for home, roused forward to race three wide in striking range near the furlong marker, kept on determinedly under pressure and drew clear in late
stages. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN sped to the lead, cleared and crossed over to the inside and set the pace with RUTHYLA not far behind, challenged for the
lead by aforementioned rival entering the far turn, dueled into stretch run, continued to dig in along the inside, held the edge over RUTHYLA but could not
match with the winner late. RUTHYLA was off to a good start from the outside and angled in to race two wide in forward position off the leader, prompted
leaving the backstretch and dueled for the lead with SNOW AND LILLYLYNN entering the turn, continued to battle back two wide at the furlong marker then
lacked a closing bid while clear over the rest. MARIANNA QUEEN settled off the pace and raced two to three wide leaving the backstretch, launched a bid
around the far turn, kept under a ride four to five wide in final furlong and lacked the late needed response for serious impact. DEBBIES UTUBE DIVA rated
near midpack along the inside down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, angled out a couple paths upper stretch and failed to
advance into closer contention. JUST LIKE INDY tracked the pace through early stages, launched a bid for command near the three eighths pole and
hustled up through the turn then had no kick left in the lane. ZANGARVA raced in the back and saved ground down the backstretch, angled out and put to a
drive five to six wide upper stretch and moved by fading foes. SIGNING BONUS raced near midpack along the outside through the backstretch then failed to
sustain bid and weakened upon entering the far turn. JOST DREAMY raced off the early pace, prompted along the inside around the far turn and failed to
move on. LADY DENISSE raced six wide and not too far back in early going then weakened entering the far turn and offered no late run. MAJOR GLADY'S
TEAM raced off the pace and two wide down the backstretch, had no response when called upon around the far turn then swung out five to six entering top
stretch and failed to factor. KINGSTON TIME was loose briefly behind the gate, steadied after the start then raced wide entering the first turn, settled off the
early pace then picked up the tempo briefly near the half mile marker, raced between rivals entering the far turn then came up empty and quickly retreated.
