BRAHMS' REGAL GAL dueled for the early advantage, drove clear down the final stretch and was kept to the task. EMILY'S PEGASUS vied for the early
lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. JOZZY BELL lacked early speed, made a late gain and was
just up for third. G G HAS A SHOT void of early speed, moved up, racing wide around the final turn, made a late wide bid and missed the show position.
SARAH ANN'S POINTE pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK raced within striking distance,
came around the first turn four wide, faded and finished evenly. BULLETSANDBOURBON raced within contention and was finished early. ORTHODRIVE
challenged for the early lead and dropped back. SHE'S A PENALTY always raced near the back and showed little. VELVET VISION raced in the back and
was never a threat.

NINE IS MINE raced on the front end, challenging BROOK IS GOLDEN for the early advantage, took the lead leaving the final turn, drove clear and proved
the best. VICTORY STRIPE void of early speed, made a late rally and was a clear second at the wire. WARRIORS WOLF pressed the pace, raced four
wide around the first turn, was close throughout and proved third best at the wire. FLY GUY RAK lacked early speed, racing in the back, moved up on the
outside down the backstretch, moved inside around the final turn, made a bid and hung. BROOK IS GOLDEN dueled on the front end, saved ground and
faded. IT'SMYLUCKYMOMENT raced within contention in the early part, faded and finished evenly near the back. GALLOPING BOOTS reserved behind
the leaders in the early going, dropped back and had nothing left late.

UNION SALUTE unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the second turn and drove clear before the wire. ZENDELPHIAN went to the
front, drove clear, led until deep in the home stretch, couldn't match strides with UNION SALUTE for the win. FORESTDUNGONE broke sharp, racing near
the front, eased back, then came again and got up for the show. DIPLOMATIC SHAFT pressed the pace, made a bid and hung down the stretch. BERKO
raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, moved up, but was no factor. GREELEY'S DEALER raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
JACK BE QUICK raced within contention, came around the first turn four wide and was finished early. DREWSIZZLE broke sharp, eased back, raced wide
around the final turn and was outrun.

SMOK'N RITA unhurried in the early going, moved up around the final turn, rallied down the stretch and drove clear before the wire. PERFECT REINS vied
for the early lead, saved ground, couldn't match strides late with SMOK'N RITA for the win, but proved best of others. RUBY SIOUX pressed the pace,
racing inside down the backside, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't keep up with the top two, but held off OPERATIC for the show position. OPERATIC
raced near the back within contention, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third. THIS IS MY PRAYER went to the front, drove clear and tired. TEMPLE
SHADOW dueled for the early advantage and dropped back.
