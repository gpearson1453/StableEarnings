Footnotes
DROP A HINT pressed the early pace three wide, dueled outside SWIRLING CANDY around the turn and through upper stretch, and drove clear through
the last eighth of a mile. KAYLA'S TUNE lost some ground to the leaders around the turn in the two-path, kept to task through the lane and was up outside
SWIRLING CANDY to get second on the wire. SWIRLING CANDY set a pressured pace inside, could not match strides with DROP A MINT through the
furlong grounds, and surrendered the place as the rider put the whip away several strides before the finish. SURMOUNT SUN pressed the early pace,
checked between SWIRLING CANDY and DROP A MINT heading into the turn, and did not recover. DREAMINOFDASIES failed to become a factor inside.
BETTIN ONNA KITTEN was outrun in the two-path. MIRIANA'S QUEEN was no factor three wide. NO GOOD DEED was a step slow at the start, and
posed no threat. APOLLO U ANYWHERE was put to pressure three wide on the turn, and lacked a solid response. LOVE OF GLORY raced three to four
wide around the turn, and made no headway on the far outside late. LOTTIE'S MIZZION was a step slow to begin, and showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
MISS ALIPHANT advanced two wide around the first turn and gained a forward position, stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, edged up closer
nearing the far turn, raced near equal terms with HILLTOP HARMONY at the quarter pole, got carried out wider by rival turning for home, dug in under right
handed pressure, shook clear in the final furlong and kept to task. HILLTOP HARMONY broke out at the start and took over the lead around the first turn,
set the pace then challenged by MISS ALIPHANT near the quarter pole, drifted out wide turning for home, battled back under steady urging but could not
match with the winner in late stages. MYFRANCESCA slightly bumped at the start then settled in opening stages, rated off the top trio down the backstretch
then launched a bid midway around the far turn, moved to the inside of wide running top pair entering the lane, stayed on with response and cleared the
rest. PANDA raced wide into the first turn then settled off the early pace, prompted along the outside around the far turn then moved into stretch five wide
and offered no late rally. MADELYN'S DANCER led the way in opening stages then conceded position to HILLTOP HARMONY around the first turn, raced
in tracking mode off the pacesetter, prompted entering the far turn, failed to advance position and steadily faded. MISS HELEN got bumped at the start,
settled off the early pace, failed to make a bid and dropped far back in stretch run.

Footnotes
JADES GELLY found a cozy spot tracking behind the leaders inside, moved off the rail nearing the quarter-pole, rallied steadily to collar MUDSLIDE
WICKED from the inside a sixteenth out, and edged clear. MUDSLIDE WICKED broke alertly and moved inside, dueled early inside two challengers, moved
clear on the turn, drifted out through upper stretch, could not withstand the winner late but was best of the others. MANE ATTRACTION hugged the rail
throughout, and finished willingly while unable to make much headway on the top two. ROMAN CITY was outrun early, moved out four wide late on the turn,
and offered a mild response for a share. SUMMER SANGRIA bumped with MYFIRSTEXWIFE after the start, tugged her way along three then four wide
around the turn, and flattened out after briefly looming a threat at the top of the lane. STORMY DERBY DAY lagged far back inside for three furlongs,
angled to the far outside in the stretch and improved position. PIVOTAL WOMAN (FR) was slow into stride, and made no impact. MYFIRSTEXWIFE
bumped with SUMMER SANGRIA after the start, and was outrun inside. ROYAL JEWEL raced in the second flight to the turn, shifted to the five-path
approaching the stretch, and lacked the needed response. DRAWNTOMUNNY dueled for the early lead between horses, and gave way before reaching the
stretch. GIBBY'S GEM unseated the rider in the post parade, pressed the pace three wide into the turn, and retreated steadily after three furlongs. LA
VIEXA showed little at the back throughout.

Footnotes
RED NATION vied for the lead out of the gate and continued to battle with INDY RULES into the turn, took on the added challenge of TRINNI TRICKS near
the quarter pole and hustled along two wide turning for home, shook free to a slim lead at head of the lane, dug in gamely under attack in late stages,
refused to give in and just lasted. WAR ACT broke in and got jostled at the start then moved out to race widest through the backstretch, advanced racing
five wide around the turn then raced wide into the lane, switched in a couple paths and kept under steady pressure, advanced into striking distance,
continued to inch up on the winner approaching the wire and just missed. TRINNI TRICKS broke on top but outsprinted for the lead, hustled long and
advanced three wide mid-turn, vied for the lead turning for home, kept on with response, raced in aim with a furlong left to run then lacked a closing kick to
get by. KING WADE got bumped at the start then raced near midpack, waited in traffic around the turn, cleared top stretch and put to a drive two wide,
raced in close range then switched to the inside late and finished evenly. RISK FOR REWARD got bumped then squeezed between rivals at the start,
moved in to race two wide leaving the backstretch, moved into stretch run six wide, stayed under steady pressure and needed more for late impact.
SNICKER KICKER raced off the early speed while hustled up from the get-go, left the backstretch racing five wide then shifted out upper stretch to race
widest in the lane and failed to make a late impact. SEVERUS vied for the lead out of the gate, could not match with the top pair into the turn and steadily
weakened. INDY RULES vied for the lead out of the gate, continued to battle back around the turn then tired in the drive. WARRIOR SPIRIT raced in range
and chased the top flight early on the failed to sustain bid and faded around the turn. BLESSD BY THE BEST bumped at the start, lacked speed and failed
to make a bid, got pulled up in the clubhouse turn after the race and walked off. CHARLIE ONE showed brief speed then quickly retreated, was pulled up
after the race and vanned off.

Footnotes
KING OF RANCH cleared to the lead first time under the wire, rated along through even fractions inside, shook away from DRAMA IN DIXE in upper stretch
and was driving to keep that foe at bay. DRAMA IN DIXIE prompted the pace outside the winner from the beginning, turned up the pressure on the far turn,
was rebuffed into the lane but ran on with good courage. POPPY'S BOYS bumped with HE'S SUPER LUCKY at the start, took the first turn three wide, and
raced evenly without posing a serious threat. HE'S SUPER LUCKY bumped with POPPY'S BOYS at the start, came under a ride three wide into the far turn,
and failed to menace. ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT saved ground on the turns in the second flight, and showed some late interest in the two-path. VERDICT IS IN
stayed close while reserved early inside, continued to hug the rail and came up empty when roused turning for home. MO'S HAD ENOUGH showed little
trailing every step.

Footnotes
RAKEEZ raced two to three wide entering the first turn then settled in the second flight tracking the top two leaders, was ridden along past the half mile
marker, continued to hustle up three wide around the turn, advanced to vie with HOLY MEISTER upper stretch, dug in under left handed pressure and
edged away. HOLY MEISTER quickly cleared on top and crossed over to the inside, set the pace with PALACE KITTEN racing in close contention then held
firm around the far turn, took on the challenge from RAKEEZ upper stretch, stayed game along the rail then lacked a closing kick. BETTERMENT settled
along the inside never far off the early pace, prompted along the rail around the final turn, shifted out three wide at head of the lane and stayed on with
response for a placing. MADE MY DAY (IRE) was unhurried in opening stages and settled in the back near the inside through early stages, raced along the
rail entering the far turn then shifted out and got carried out wide turning for home, continued a steady bid and edged closer. PALACE KITTEN was
forwardly placed around the first turn, continued to race in striking distance of the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for command
around the far turn, failed to advance position and flattened out in the lane. SENATOR stalked and saved ground down the backstretch, roused for response
along the rail near the quarter pole, cut the corner and raced up close then switched out a path and gave way. STARE DECISIS rated three wide while not
far off the early pace, roused for more entering the far turn, shifted out wider turning for home, stayed under left handed pressure in stretch run, made slight
contact with MADE MY DAY and had no late kick.

Footnotes
IL FARAONE was void of early speed while moving inside, stayed glued to the rail with clear sailing into the stretch, kicked in through the furlong grounds to
reach contention, overtook the leaders a sixteenth out and was going away under a mild drive. LOVE NEST vied outside three opponents up the
backstretch, remained head and head outside ONE FINE RIDE leaving the turn in the three-path, bested that one through mid stretch but could not
withstand the top one. ONE FINE RIDE argued the pace innermost of four early, entered the lane in the two-path battling inside LOVE NEST, and yielded
grudgingly past the eighth-pole. SI ES GOYA contested the front between horses in the two-path early, and dropped out of it at the top of the stretch.
GINGER SKY had decent position just off the leading foursome into the turn, but lacked the needed bid in the four-path. HE'S SMOKIN HOT got squeezed
back between horses at the start, and was no factor three wide. SO NIFTY was involved in the early pace scrimmage three wide between foes, and gave
way on the turn. DRAGUNOV eyed the leaders two wide into the turn, but began to fade before completing six furlongs. ABBOT was crowded after the start,
and retired early.

CHICLET'S DREAM hustled up out of the gate, gained a contending position then settled and raced two to three wide entering the first turn, rated five to six
wide off the early pace, let out a notch entering the far turn, loomed up boldly near the quarter pole, took command then drifted out wider in stretch run, kept
to task under steady pressure and held clear. REGAL ROMANCE settled four to five wide through early stages, prompted and advanced closer along the
outside near the quarter pole, remained in steady pursuit for CHICLET'S DREAM, shifted out wider and produced a solid effort but could not reach the
winner. HENNY'S TREASURE broke out at the start, raced off the pace down the backstretch, picked up the tempo near the three eighths pole, roused six
wide into the lane, sustained bid in stretch run and gained show. SISTER GEMA settled two to three wide off the early pace, was patiently ridden in some
traffic around the final turn then put to a drive top of the lane, produced a mild kick and improved. ELITE APPEAL raced inside off the clear top pair in early
stages, switched out a couple paths and hustled along three wide between foes turning for home, gained closer contention upper stretch but failed to sustain
kick and flattened out. TELL ME MAUX was unhurried and saved ground while racing in the rear, picked up the pace entering the far turn, came under left
handed pressure and raced six wide upper stretch, gained position but needed more for late impact. QUIET ALL AROUND secured inside position in early
stages and settled off the early pace, was patiently handled around the far turn then went to make a move along the rail top stretch but lacked room, was
taken up and lost all momentum. TENNESSEE COTTON was keyed up and advanced along the outside to be forwardly placed in the first turn, vied for the
lead with VELVET ISLE down the backstretch, continued a bid into the final turn then failed to be a match when the winner loomed up past the quarter pole
and faded. VELVET ISLE grabbed the lead out of the gate and held a slim lead around the first turn, maintained the edge and vied with TENNESSEE
COTTON while clear over the next pursuer down the backstretch, continued to hold on top into the final turn then got collared by the winner and tired in the
drive. DUDICIOUS was the closest pursuer of the clear top pair through early stages then failed to keep pace and retreated around the far turn.

SNIPER SHOT came away in good order, scrimmaged up front outside three opponents for a half-mile or so, took over through the furlong grounds under a
drive and drew away as much the best. WHO'S OUT hustled up after the break to gain a short lead inside, went along hounded by three rivals to the end of
the turn, and dug in gamely on the rail to hold the place. HARD BELLE was part of the early pace scrum three wide between horses, weakened leaving the
turn, then ran on with good courage to come back for the show. VINCERO settled off the four-way dispute for the lead, came five wide in range at the top of
the stretch, but made no significant headway. VINNIE VAN GO battled up front between rivals in the two-path, and weakened past the eighth-pole.

Footnotes
YAKO secured inside position in the first turn then stayed near the inside and settled off the early pace, tipped out and prompted near the quarter pole, split
foes gamely upper stretch then stayed sharp in response and got up in final strides. CHARGE IT JENN was forwardly placed around the first turn, applied
pace pressure to ALGODONAL down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for rival in the far turn, kept under a drive and raced in striking range in the
final furlong, continued to inch up on the leader, got outkicked for the win and finished on equal terms with ALGONDONAL for place. ALGODONAL took
over the lead nearing the first turn, set the pace with CHARGE IT JENN applying outside pressure, held firm around the final turn, dug in gamely with a
furlong left to run, held a slim lead then got outkicked for the win by late gainer deep stretch and finished on equal terms with CHARGE IT JENN for place.
LIBERALE (FR) settled under slight restraint racing two to three wide down the backstretch, picked up the pace around the final turn, was put to a drive
racing seven wide upper stretch and edged closer in final stages. CHA CHA HEELS was allowed to settle early on and rated off the pace, hustled up along
the outside around the far turn, raced wide under a drive in the lane, finished with interest and edged closer late. TROPICALITY raced near midpack to the
far turn, prompted along the outside then moved into upper stretch six wide, gained position then evened out. ITS ABOUT ME arced near mid-range down
the backstretch, roused racing two path around the final turn, was forced to check upper stretch and lost momentum. PASSING MOMENTS tracked the top
two leaders while saving ground along the inside, launched a bid mid-way around the far turn but failed to advance then weakened in the lane. IMPERIAL
CUT was unhurried through early stages and raced near the inside then raced along the outside around the far turn, was set down for the drive racing wide
in the lane and lacked a needed rally. TRIXIE'S TIME raced in range and tracked the early pace, hustled up around the far turn, kept on upper stretch then
came up empty in final furlong. CALAIS COVE was unhurried, raced near the rear, prompted left handed upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. OBLIO'S
WISH was reserved racing in the back positioned along the outside and failed to move into contention.
