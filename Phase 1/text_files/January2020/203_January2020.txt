Footnotes
ZENUCCI was slowest into stride, settled well back in the field, was ridden along while three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, switched to
the proper lead while rallying outside at the three-sixteenths, closed strongly into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead around the sixteenth-pole
and got up under strong handling. WHERE Y'AT JOE JOE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid under a
right-handed whip in upper stretch, drifted out after being switched to a left-handed whip coming to the furlong marker, was straightened and switched back
to a right-handed whip shortly thereafter, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while well clear for the place. C'MON VE broke very fast, showed good
speed and set the pace, moved clear outside the seven-sixteenths, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was asked at the three-sixteenths, lost the
lead shortly thereafter, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. SNAPPER BITE moved up to press the pace on the
inside, dropped back outside the seven-sixteenths, saved ground under urging on the turn and came up empty. CASE'S TICKET dropped back early, was
urged along while inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. WHATELSE IGOT TODO dropped back
midway down the backstretch then moved in, shifted out three wide into the turn, dropped back fast while floating five then six wide around the
five-sixteenths and capitulated. C C HARRIS broke out then was hustled, tracked the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was
urged three to four wide on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON was nicely maneuvered towards the inside at the rear of the field on the initial straightaway, settled towards the back, was roused
in the two path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out under a drive in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final
furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth under good handling. IM A COWBOY TOO went to the front when CHASE FOR THE GOLD was
wrestled back off the pace before the first turn, set the pace in the two path, was asked outside the three-sixteenths, came under the whip inside the furlong
marker, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the place. PAPA'S BOY broke out then brushed with a foe, went four then three wide on
the first turn, was rated in a good position towards the front, drafted inside under restraint while just behind the leader on the far turn, was asked in the two
path while given a large opening into upper stretch, moved out in pursuit of the leader at the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a left-handed whip between
the eighth-pole and sixteenth-pole then lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT broke a bit slow, tossed his head
while rank under restraint on the initial straightaway, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch,
was asked in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MAGIC VOW went three wide on the first turn,
bumped with a rival while between horses around the five-eighths, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, spun six wide into
the stretch and came up empty. GRANDE BASIN broke a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along while
three for most of the far turn then shifted four wide, swung eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CHANGI went four wide on the first turn,
bumped with a foe while between horses near the five-eighths then steadied, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, came
seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left. LUCKY INFERNO brushed with a foe at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
was urged along while five wide on the far turn and also came up empty. KING CAKE went four wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged
along while four then five wide on the far turn, came nine wide into the stretch and was no factor. CHASE FOR THE GOLD went to the front, fought hard
against the rating tactics of the rider when taken in hand then was wrestled back while tossing his head badly, went three wide on the first turn, prompted
the pace on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
SUCRE was quickly clear racing in hand to dictate terms, went just off the rail through the turn, was asked for run at the three-sixteenths and responded
then received steady hand urging late. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR switched off the inside early to stalk the leader a path or two removed from the rail, went in
about the three path through the turn still a measured distance from the leader, asked for more having come out a further path at the quarter pole but could
make no headway in the stretch. GIRLS LIFE settled last but one racing off the inside, shifted to the rail entering the turn, saved ground and was asked for
run at the top of the stretch but failed to produce a rally. DOUBLE DOWN BRITT broke out significantly and a half step slowly, was mildly coaxed along
early, shifted in to the rail heading into the turn but soon came out a path to race in the two path through the bend trailing the field, was given more
encouragement past the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide in upper stretch near the three-sixteenths and failed to make a bid.

turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved clear around the three-sixteenths, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging.
SKYCRAFT saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back of the spread out field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive, dropped in some while gaining outside the furlong marker and finished with good energy for the place. MORNING STRIDE went three
to four wide on the first turn, settled well back on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and
improved position to get the show. MUCHO MACHO BETS went around the first turn in the two path, settled well off the pace, entered the far turn near the
rail then angled five wide, came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. CONSUMERCONFIDENCE raced in the two path on
the first turn, settled in third position, advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and tired.
MUSTANG CAT went four wide on the first turn, settled in the front half of the field on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, moved
out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. HERECOMESYOURMAN went five wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside,
moved in late on the backstretch, entered the far turn in the two path then angled four wide, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BARATTI

then moved to five wide outside the five-sixteenths, came eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FOLDOVER bumped hard with a foe at the start,
showed early speed, bobbled while three wide into the first turn then dropped to the rail, contested the pace on the inside, vied along the rail under urging on
the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded. VALYCOVE went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while four to five
wide on the far turn and was no factor. TURBO STREET (AUS) was off about two lengths slow, moved up while angling in early then tugged hard at the bit
while keen under restraint, went three then two wide on the first turn, bobbled late on that bend, settled off the pace, dropped back while inside on the far
turn and faltered then was pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
WAR COUNT settled into stride just off the leaders tucking in behind them in about the two to three path leaving the backstretch, edged closer leaving the
turn then moved between foes at the top of the stretch to take a narrow lead, was clear past the furlong marker and held sway while kept to task late.
BROTHER RICHIE was in just a bit tight after the break and taken a hold of then moved inward, continued to shift in about the two to three path into the turn
settling well mid-pack, had room following the winner in the stretch, drifted out a bit late and kept on gamely to secure the place. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY was
taken up at the start as a rival came out, kept quite wide while moving up heading to the turn, maintained position in about the four to five path through the
turn coming out a further path into the stretch, drifted in a bit in late stretch and evened out. BOSTON BIND pressed from outside going four wide into the
turn then carried out a path early on that bend, made a mild bid in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner and was in a bit tight between rivals late
and steadied just slightly then yielded. DOUBLE COOL broke a half-step slowly and was squeezed back, settled at the rear in the two to three path on the
turn coming four wide into upper stretch, gained mildly. CLOSING AMERICAN came out several paths at and just after the break while being urged forward
to set the pace for the opening three-sixteenths, was thereupon joined by inside and outside rivals, appeared to be getting out a bit into the turn contending
between rivals but in the four path on that bend, weakened in upper stretch then angled out late. GRAND LITTLE MAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival,
settled inside last but one through the turn coming out a path to pass a tired rival in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MIDNIGHT BAYOU was bumped
and forced out at the start then urged forward inside to contest the early lead, vied along the rail through the turn but faltered in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
KINGPIN broke very fast then sped clear, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off under the
whip into the final seventy yards then was put to hand ride while much the best. LONTANO broke a bit slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up
under urging, was guided around the turn along the rail, swung four wide into the stretch while roused, chased the winner into the final furlong and proved
no match while able to get the place. SCHMOOZIN broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch while in hand, saved
ground on the turn, was taken up some while negotiating the elbow of that bend, cut the corner while roused into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while up for the show. BROADCAST LEGEND chased the pace from second, raced in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive into the final furlong and tired. GOVERNALE was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to rally. KIANG was
bumped hard at the start, raced towards the front on the outside under urging, moved in late on the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and also
failed to rally. TAP ATTACK was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. JACK
BEANSTALK broke out and bumped hard with a rival, was forwardly placed on the outside, went four wide under urging on the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and came up empty. HOFFA broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. AUTUMN JETT
broke a half-step slow, settled outside towards the rear under some urging, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and showed
little. MAGA COUNTRY was urged along at the rear, checked very sharply leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came out significantly into
upper stretch and was distanced.

Footnotes
MR. BIG NEWS settled into stride early entering the first turn four wide then coming in a path late on that bend content to track off the leaders toward the
rear, began to pick it up three wide moving between foes early on the far turn then tipping out a further path on that bend, took aim in upper stretch, drifted a
bit in the lane but got up just in time. WILD UNION attended then pressed outside the pacesetter three wide into the first turn, kept wide up the backstretch
entering the far turn still three wide, took over a narrow lead after shifting in a path late on that bend, was clear in the stretch but nailed late. CERNAN went
three to four wide outside rivals into the first turn, stalked in behind up the backstretch, was in the clear commencing an advance three wide on the far turn,
challenged briefly near the furlong marker but could not sustain the effort. FIRST CITIZEN was getting out badly to about the seven path entering the first
turn, was corrected and shifted back in about four wide by the end of that bend, was encouraged along by the three-eighths going in the three path on the
far turn and toward the rear well off the leaders, came out a path into upper stretch and ran on. BAYERN TO BE WILD set the pace inside facing pressure
from an outside rival, saved ground through the turn but weakened beginning at the top of the stretch. EL SUPREMO was a bit rank to place and getting out
to the three path into the first turn, shifted in a path then nearer the rail leaving that bend, tracked off the leaders inside or in the two path up the backstretch
into the far turn, came out three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. PYSER'S ORB was rank early then bore out eight deep into the first turn,
continued keenly and advanced rapidly outside rivals to be just off the leading pair early up the backstretch, dropped back into the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
ALBA'S STAR went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the clear pace through solid fractions, raced near the rail on the far turn,
responded well when set down in upper stretch, was given a few taps of a down-turned whip while extending the advantage approaching the furlong marker
and drew off under a brisk hand ride. URBANA bumped hard with a rival at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled towards the back, was
urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, moved out from behind foes around the three-sixteenths, passed
rivals into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and secured the place. FLABBERGASTED went four then three wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner under the whip past the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened then lost the place but was clear for the show. SLIME QUEEN bumped lightly with CAZADORA at the start, bumped again with that
foe early then was taken up briefly, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and
lacked the needed response. U S S LEXINGTON lunged at the start then bobbled and bumped hard with a rival, settled towards the inside, was urged along
on the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, was bumped while carried six wide into the stretch then forced into another foe and also lacked the
needed response. CAZADORA bumped lightly with SLIME QUEEN early, bumped again with that foe early, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled
off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. DREAMING OF PARIS went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, bumped with a foe while carried seven wide into the stretch and came up empty. TITAN'S
TREASURE broke out at the start, was well placed just off the pace near the inside, came under urging on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and
bumped with U S S LEXINGTON then tired. SATURDAY SUN angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on both turns and was no factor. VINTAGE
READY broke out and hit the gate, was taken under a tight hold early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back, came under urging late
on the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and never reached contention. DARLING BELLE went five wide on the first
turn, was reserved on the outside, dropped back under urging while three to four wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER showed good speed and set the clear pace, drew off while inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch,
shortened stride while still well clear into the final sixteenth and held desperately under strong urging. TWO UTES broke a bit slow then was taken up, was
urged along at the rear, went four then three wide on the turn, rallied into the final furlong and closed well to just miss while able to get the place. MR.
PRODUCTION broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out some under a
drive around the three-sixteenths, gained on the winner in the final furlong and missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. MY PAL JAC chased
winner from the second, dropped further behind that foe in the two path on the turn, gained under a drive in the final furlong and just missed the show. HALF
A BITE dropped back early then was urged along well off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. VENN broke a half-step slow, was urged
along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SEELEY dropped back while ridden
along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TIZ NEYNEY AND RAD broke through the front of the gate prior to the start
then was brought back around and reloaded, was ridden along while last but one, dropped to the rear into the turn, saved ground on that bend and showed
little.
