Footnotes
MEET ME HALF WAY trailed through the clubhouse turn, remained unhurried for five furlongs, circled her field steadily on the far turn and into the stretch,
made the lead before the furlong marker and finished full of run to win as much the best while under a strong hand ride late. TOMATO BISQUE battled
along the inside into the clubhouse turn, dropped back and angled outside the leader, re engaged before a half, matched strides into the stretch while
drifting out to the five path, drifted out under left handed urging past the furlong marker bumping IF YOU BELIEVE and gamely held on for second. IF YOU
BELIEVE stalked the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly nearing the top of the stretch, was forced out to the six path before the furlong marker, was
bumped by the runner up and just missed second. PULLED THE GOALIE offered a mild bid on the far turn then came up empty. HEAD DRESS contested
the lead two wide into the clubhouse turn, edged clear, battled near the inside into the far turn then was used up. FACTUM'S REWARD was no factor. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF IF YOU BELIEVE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TOMATO
BISQUE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TOMATO BISQUE AND PLACED HER THIRD.

GONE TOO SOON trailed for a little over a half, circled his field at will in the six path on the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong
marker and finished full of run under mild urging to win going away. TIZ A RUSH chased the winner into the far turn, loomed boldly in the four path and
finished second best in a game effort. DECADENT DOC made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished in the three
path. MAKE THE CALL offered a mild bid in the four on the far turn then leveled off. HANSENATION inched closer along the rail into the stretch then failed
to sustain that bid. CANDY EXCHANGE chased the pace three wide and was through after a half. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE chased the pace two wide for a
half then gave way. REALITY'S ROAD had speed for a half then faltered.

Footnotes
GENTLE KISS chased the leader two wide into the far turn, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch, shook clear under left handed urging before the
furlong marker and won under right handed urging. SWEET BAYTOWN never far back, was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late in the four path
while well clear for second. PRADO'S TRUST well placed, went evenly. ONCE IS FOREVER failed to menace. SILKY TASSELS was no threat. SHEFLEW
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then gradually weakened along the inside. SHES JUST CAPITAL was no
factor. CHIPLEE was always outrun. HALEYS COURT had brief speed. STERLING RING chased the pace for a half then stopped.
