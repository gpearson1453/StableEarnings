Footnotes
FREE FLAY dashed to the front at the start, showed the way inside to the stretch and widened under pressure. BLIP advanced two then three wide
approaching the quarter-pole, made no impression on the winner but bested the others. KHOZY MY BOY bumped with KING SHAWN while moving through
on the rail near the three-eighths, came three wide into the lane and was just up inside CHINOMADITO for the show. CHINOMADITO stayed in range four
wide for a half-mile, and faded on the far outside. CAPTAIN YENNER chased after the winner to mid stretch, and tired. BRIAN'S AVENUE broke outward,
pressed the early pace on the rail, and faltered after a half-mile. KING SHAWN was bothered by BRIAN'S ADVENTURE at the start and slow to begin,
bumped with KHOZY MY BOY midway on the turn, and dropped far back. CHANELIN was finished early inside.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM cleared on top and angled inside shortly after the start and continued on top near the inside around the first turn, set the uncontested
pace down the backstretch then remained clear still unleashed around the far turn, prompted to pick up the pace turning for home, widened advantage on
top then stayed clear and sharp under a mild drive. GAUGUIN (GER) was allowed to settle out of the gate then rated off the second flight to the far turn,
picked up the pace near the three eighths pole, roused three wide into upper stretch, moved by SHORE MAGIC to race off the leader then lacked the
needed response to reach the winner. SHORE MAGIC broke in and bumped with rival at the start then placed forwardly along the rail on the first turn,
stayed inside and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, got collared for second position leaving the
furlong marker, kept under a ride and stayed on for share. WISE TO LISTEN bumped with rival at the start, remained unhurried and settled in the back
saving ground to the far turn, urged for response along the rail then angled out entering top stretch, shifted back to the inside and needed more for late
impact. TOTONO raced three to four wide off the early pace, dropped to the rail on the final turn and had no response when called upon. DIFFERENTIAL
raced three wide in close contention moving around the first turn, remained forwardly placed and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch then came up
empty and retreated in the far turn.

BLUE EYED BETH broke out brushing GREY MANNERS at the start, sped to the front inside, was clear into the stretch and held on late. BLUE BLUE ICE
advanced three wide after a half-mile, raced outside through the drive and was along for the place in the final yards. STORMY BOSS chased three wide
from the outset, had a clear shot outside the winner through the lane, could not reach her and lost the place late. GREY MANNERS pressed the pace
outside the winner for a half-mile, and faded in the stretch. CHIC AND SEXY was four wide leaving the turn, and lacked the needed response. SKY RUN
broke open the stall door prior to the start, came away alertly showing brief speed inside, but was done before reaching the stretch. MISS CHLOE G trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
MAKABIM was off a step slow at the start, steadily advanced into closer position down the backstretch and around the turn, was under a drive three wide at
the quarter pole, roused forward to challenge the leader near the furlong marker, dug in under firm handling and edged away. BAZOO held a slim lead
under a snug hold out of the chute, continued on top down the backstretch and held firm around the turn, fought back when challenged by MAKABIM near
the furlong marker then got collared for the lead and gave way grudgingly. QUALITY ON TAP slightly drifted in a path a step out of the gate then angled
inside and remained forwardly positioned to the far turn, switched out a path and hustled along into stretch run, moved out wider and finished wrapped up
for show. DR G'S HOPE raced up close out of the chute and continued just off the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid in two path entering the
far turn then gave way near the quarter pole. WARRANT OFFICER raced in range off the top trio through early stages, had no response and lost ground
around the turn then prompted upper stretch to no avail. EXATLON trailed in the back and allowed to gallop home under no exertion by the rider

IN A HURRY was in no hurry early, advanced two wide awaiting room behind the leaders a quarter-mile out, slipped to the three-path for clearance in upper
stretch, had the rider drop the whip through the furlong grounds, but finished determinedly under hand urging to wear down WITEZ. The latter vied between
horses for six furlongs, took over outside QUEEN OF GOD in upper stretch, was briefly clear into the last eighth of a mile but could not resist the winner.
ELLA BRILLA prompted the pace three wide to the stretch, and was one-paced to the finish outside the top two. QUEEN OF GOD rated along on a short
lead inside for six furlongs, and weakened turning for home. ABARRIO FOREVER was a bit keen heading to the first turn, saved ground coming under a
ride into the far turn, had no response and dropped steadily farther behind.

OMNIA broke out and hit the gate at the start, took the lead nearing the first turn, set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, picked up the pace
and held off challenger's around the far turn, came under attack from LANDY PANDA upper stretch, dug in gamely from the rail position, turned back bid
and moved away. LADY PANDA brushed with rival at the start then rated near mid-pack down the backstretch, launched an outside bid and loomed up late
far turn, vied for the lead with OMNIA at the furlong marker, continued to put in a good effort but could not match with game winner in final stages. LEMON
DROP TINI was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the leader along the rail to the far turn, was patiently handled along the inside then shifted out
three wide top stretch and stayed on with response. MISS ADVENTURE raced three wide entering the first turn, settled nicely and tracked the pace through
early stages, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, flattened a bit upper stretch then stayed on evenly. R V TREASURE bumped with rival at the
start then raced under slight restraint and took back off the early pace, saved ground and moved inside going by the quarter pole, shifted out turning for
home and put to a drive but failed to kick on. SILVER TAKE CHARGE raced outside in the last flight through early stages, urged for response around the far
turn, kept under a ride four wide upper stretch but lacked a needed rally. POLISHED COPPER raced four wide into the first turn, settled off the early pace
then coaxed along the outside on the final turn and failed to gain a threatening position. MALIBU TOO raced in or near the back and failed to respond when
called upon. SO DEAR was forwardly placed and stalked the leader to the far turn then retreated.

R U LUCKY vied inside FIVE OF HEARTS early, disposed of that one after a half-mile, was roused to kick away from BROADWAY PETE into the stretch
and drew off flashed the whip and vigorously hand urged. ASSERTIKO saved ground off the leaders to the stretch, and rallied mildly on the rail to nip
BEYOND GONE for the runner-up position. BEYOND GONE chased after the leaders toward the inside, moved to the two-path for the drive and was
outfinished for second. BROADWAY PETE broke outward, raced in easy striking range outside the battling leaders to the turn, lodged a mild bid with
five-sixteenths remaining, but faded through the lane. PLATO hit the left side of the gate and was off slowly, trailed three wide to the stretch and could not
gain. FIVE OF HEARTS vied outside R U LUCKY, and gave way soon after completing a half.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET held a slim lead over HEIR BALL in opening stages and continued with the edge around the turn, widened to a clear advantage upper
stretch then stayed sharp in response and finished going away under a strong hand ride. HEIR BALL was off to a good start then conceded position to MISS
AURAMET and remained in striking distance on the leader around the turn, could not move on with winner upper stretch but stayed on with response for
second best. GIOIELLI raced near mid-pack in early stages then coaxed three wide at the quarter pole, continued in steady pursuit through stretch run and
got a nose up for show. WAR STAR leaned in and bumped with rival at the start, tugged up closer racing near two path under slight restraint then moved
through the turn between foes, came out upper stretch then shifted back in, gained position two wide then yielded and got nipped for show. GHOSTLY
BEAUTY raced along the inside In the back then hustled up and shifted out leaving the turn, raced wide into stretch run, continued with interest but needed
more for serious impact. SWEET YARE N DIRA bumped with rival at the start then hustled along under steady urging, was positioned in range then
steadied mid-way around the turn, lost momentum then raced wide into upper stretch and offered no late rally. TRUE HEIRESS raced near the back then
moved into stretch run five wide under a drive and lacked a needed rally. CORY GAL was forwardly placed and boxed in along the inside through opening
stages, continued on the inside around the turn, given cue top stretch but quickly faded. LADY NOY raced along the rail not far off the leaders in early
stages then gave way around the turn.

DAY BY DAY eased back off the early leaders up the backstretch, stayed in range three wide around the turn, began to close in on R PREROGATIVE from
outside in upper stretch, blew by entering the last furlong being flashed the whip, and drew away under mild hand urging. SANAABLE was outsprinted early,
came three wide off the turn, and rallied past R PREROGATIVE through the last 70 yards for second. ANGELIA raced well back to the stretch three wide,
and was up in the last strides to get the show. R PREROGATIVE sprinted clear from KATIELEIGH approaching the half-mile pole, was put to a drive at the
top of the stretch with DAY BY DAY bearing down on her, could not cope with that one through the furlong grounds, and weakened through the late stages.
CARIBA was done early inside. KATIELEIGH vied inside R PREROGATIVE early, got shaken off heading to the turn and faded steadily.

ROONEY was allowed to settle in early stages then steadily edged up closer, dropped to the inside and continued to inch closer while patiently handled
around the far turn, roused forward up the inside turning for home, assumed command and kicked clear. WILD ABOUT THIS vied for the lead around the
first turn then set a pressured pace down the backstretch, cleared on top around the far turn then got collared when the winner move up the inside and
seized command upper stretch. ALWAYS LUCKY tracked the pace along the inside to the far turn, prompted in two path to go after the leader near the
quarter pole then continued a steady bid through the lane and narrowly missed place. FUNNY FEATHER got bumped a step out then was unhurried and
raced near the inside, picked up the pace then shifted out late far turn, set down five wide for the drive, gained position but needed more for serious impact.
TAPIZAR GIRL raced two to three wide off the early pace, urged to pick up the pace near the three eighths pole, was put to a drive on the inside turning for
home, gained position then flattened out. BAILATINO steadied slightly entering the first turn, rated near mid-pack down the backstretch, launched a bid
midway around the far turn but failed to mount a serious challenge. SAVVY CAIRO vied for the lead around the first turn, applied pace pressure to WILD
ABOUT THIS down the backstretch, failed to remain in touch with leader entering the far turn then gave way in the lane. LITTLE EVY was unhurried, saved
ground and failed to move into contention. AURORA NATION steadily faded throughout. YASNAI'S LAW floated out and raced up close around the first
turn, remained forwardly placed in striking range down the backstretch then came up empty on the far turn. JUST MARITZA raced along the outside into the
