Footnotes
FOOLISH EQUATION stumbled a few strides out of the gate, was allowed to settle, rallied two wide on the turn making the lead near the quarter pole, set
the balance of the pace under contact pressure and proved best under mild left handed urging. GOLDEN MONEY never far back, loomed boldly three wide
on the turn, pressured the winner the balance of the trip and finished second best. BEARPATH chased the pace from the three path early, steadied nearing
the turn, shifted out to the six path past the quarter pole then went evenly. NOTARIZED failed to menace. HUGH ARE YOU made the lead shortly after the
start, set the pace along the inside for a half then gradually weakened. JOES A ROCKIN was no threat. KANDY CHARGE was no factor. SMASHED
POTATOES had brief speed.

drew off under right handed urging. TIGER LISA stalked the pace and just got up for second in a stretch long drive three wide. BOUCAN pressed the pace
two wide and finished with good courage. INCLUDERE made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear before the
furlong marker then weakened. NICE RIDE passed tiring rivals in the seven path through the stretch. LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) was no factor. SEALED
WITH A KISS hopped at the start and failed to reach contention. THEOREM was through after a half.

Footnotes
PALLADIUM chased the pace three wide, dropped back a bit approaching the stretch, dug in determinedly in the five path through the final sixteenth under
left handed urging and got up in the final strides. DELTA EXPRESS away alertly, set all the pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch and was caught in the
final jump. DIMATE unhurried around the clubhouse turn, circled rivals four wide before a half, prompted the balance of the pace two wide and was
outfinished despite a game effort. PRAIRIE CHIEF close up inside, went evenly. OFF SIXES failed to menace. GOOD MORNING JACK stalked the pace
into the stretch then faded. KING OLLIE well placed, lacked the needed response. STOP THE PARADE trailed.

Footnotes
SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS prompted the pace along the inside into the turn, checked while lacking room behind the leader at the three eighths pole, altered
course sharply to the seven path nearing the top of the stretch, closed with a burst of speed to make the lead past the furlong marker and won going away.
OVER THE BLUES bumped at the start, loomed boldly four wide on the turn, matched strides into the stretch, was bumped near the furlong marker and
finished second best. MORNINGSTARDUST never far back, finished with good courage in the seven path. MY GOOD GIRL never far back, rallied five wide
to make the lead on the turn, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out under a left handed whip bumping the runner up near the eighth pole then was
outfinished. MISS MARINETTE failed to menace. CHIT CHATTING pressed the pace three then two wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead
before the quarter pole, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. GAGLIANO was no factor. QUALITY H TWO O bumped at the start, was a sharp
threat four wide into the turn then weakened. DUST TO DIAMONDS had speed into the turn then folded. MISS IRISH BOSS away alertly, set the pace near
the inside into the turn then stopped.

DOUBLE D'S REVENGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch while drifting out under
right handed urging to win as much the best. LIL COUNTRY GRAD never far back, rallied late in the five path and finished clear for second. CIRCLE WILL
RUN allowed to settle, offered a bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. ALWAYS DIALED IN chased the winner into the turn, inched closer in
the four path then failed to sustain that bid. ANSWER QUIETLY vied for the lead along the inside and failed to offer the needed response. NOT A FLIRT
failed to menace. LINDA N MICHELLE with the second flight three wide, was through after a half. SILKY TASSELS was outrun. PATTI GO GIRL was no
factor. THUNDERTAP was no threat. THISGIRLISGOLDEN hopped at the start, had speed for a half then stopped.

Footnotes
FASTEST MAX matched strides for the lead three wide into the turn, edged clear before a half then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best.
SQUEEGEE unhurried early, rallied through the stretch in the seven path and finished second best. RISKY GUY never far back, finished with good courage
in the five path. RARIFIED AIR passed tiring rivals late in the six path. NOBLE DAVE went evenly. ALYCAR FLASH dueled for the lead near the inside into
the turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CORKY'S THE NAME pressed the pace along the inside into the turn
and was through after a half. OUT AT EIGHT had brief speed inside. SUM SONG was unprepared for the start and trailed throughout. CHURCH MONKEY
with the second flight two wide,flattened out on the turn.
