Footnotes
PRINCIPAL DANCER away well, prompted the pace from the two path, crept up as the half was being completed, challenged in earnest at the
three-sixteenths pole, took charge in short order, then kicked away in the last eighth. APEX PREDATOR off the inside throughout, pursued the pace three
wide on the turn, was switched over to a drive a short distance from the quarter pole, angled five wide for the drive home, went on to secure second.
GONGHEIFATCHOY was briskly urged during the initial stages to cement itself to the top, showed the way from along the inside route, shadowed by the
winner from the outside, was put to the test by that opponent in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, succumbed then steadily backed away into
third. THE JOKE'S ON YOU slid into the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, kept an eye on the front runners, got roused at the
five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch, lacked a response and gave way. TALESPIN saved ground to no avail. WELL IN TUNE took up the
chase from the two path on the turn, turned into lane from the same path, had no offering. FREUDIAN ANALYST broke a half length the fastest, fell back
into midpack almost immediately, departed the backstretch from the four path, was through after going a half.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC AFFAIR coaxed from the gate, dueled in hand from the four path with WE SHOULD TALK to his inside, tucked to the two path into the turn,
remained patiently handled through the bend knocking heads with his main pace rival, took over narrow command and swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, got set down straightened away, came in safely clear under a near sided stick near the eighth pole, inched away under a drive kept to task. WE
SHOULD TALK hustled from the gate, dueled three then two wide down the backstretch with the aforementioned foe to his outside, tucked inside half a mile
from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got headed for command and spun just off the inside for home, got shaken off straightened away
and ran on clear of the rest to be along second best. JAVELIN coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BOOTLEGGER (FR) chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. GYPSUM JOHNNY chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the
turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE chased along the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
WAR STOPPER grabbed the advantage shortly after the start, sailed along well in the two path on a loosely-contested lead, opened up on the competition
during the run around the bend, some of them being encouraged themselves in varying degrees by this juncture, stepped up to the three-sixteenths pole
and was switched over to some urging himself, responded, maintaining a comfortable margin against the only stretch threat. CONTINUATION gathered
after coming in at the start, pursued the pace from the two path, angled into the third one for the drive home, showed enough willingness to earn the second
best designation. WILD CAT WEST took up position in midpack after the field had been released, departed the backstretch from the four path, as the widest
of all, got roused right around the five-sixteenths pole, swung four wide into the lane, clearly proved no match today. FIRST LINE faltered off a
ground-saving journey. CALL ME LATER well rated on the backstretch, underwent a three wide tripon the turn, gave way. RED MERCURY sluggish after
shying in at the break, cut over to the inside route early on the backstretch, continued to take it on the turn, was moved out five wide for the drive home, had
no response and wound up trailing nearly throughout.

CITY TEMPER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from HOT LITTLE HONEY to the outside, widened
away in tandem with a pair through the turn patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home set down for the
drive, drew off under a drive to prevail. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to be along clear for the place honors. HOT
LITTLE HONEY broke outwards under coaxing from the start and took over the lane of PRETTY FABULOUS, prompted the leader four to five wide from the
outside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home,
weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. PRETTY FABULOUS got bumped at the start by EYE'M GONE breaking inwards and lost her
lane to the breaking outwards HOT LITTLE HONEY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and
improved position for the last major share. REBEL EMPRESS four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper
stretch, tired. EYE'M GONE broke in at the start bumping PRETTY FABULOUS, then got brushed by LUZMARIA who followed her inwards, chased three to
four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. LUZMARIA broke in at the start and brushed with
the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide pushed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. JIMMYS LASS hustled from the
gate, showed brief speed along the inside, got shaken off into the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, faded through the turn, went just off
the inside into upper stretch and folded. OVER THIRSTY chased just off the inside coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper
stretch, trailed.

Footnotes
QUEST FOR FIRE away a half length the fastest, remained forwardly placed, pressed the issue the two path, hand urged by the pilot, although not briskly
so, chipped away at the margin late on the bend, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and got turned loose, forged to the front, edged away then held on well
to stay comfortably in the clear. OUR STORMIN NORMAN brushed a few strides into the contest, settled into stride afterwards, steadily advanced towards
the front runners from the two path on the turn, angled one farther off the rail heading onto the top of the lane, failed to make any headway in the final
furlong. BASSMAN DAVE gained the lead soon after the start, was along the inside holding off the winner for the opening half, was switched over to
stronger handling as the second split was about to be posted, relinquished when challenged by the top one a sixteenth later, weakened into the show slot.
BRONXVILLE forwardly placed three wide, got asked to pick it up in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, tipped four wide into the lane, lacked the
needed response. TIZANOXBOW got bumped lightly in the shadow of the starting gate, went on to take up the chase from path three in midpack, swung
about as wide into lane, made no impact. NO MORE MIRACLES departed the backstretch from path four, came under a ride prior to reaching the quarter
pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no offering and backed away. SPLIT VERDICT sent over to the rail at the half mile pole, rode it to the end of
the bend, angled two to three wide into the stretch, came up empty. MOONBOUNCE pinched after becoming entangled with a pair of opponents shortly
after the field had been sent off and running, cut over to the rail, went on to save ground to no avail. GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR travelled two wide on the turn,
fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, had no gain.

Footnotes
CERRETALTO got steadied briefly early on when in tight alongside READY TO ESCAPE as CHARGE AHEAD crossed over in front, chased just off the
inside down the backstretch from just off the pace, remained just off the inside through the turn coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole, got set
down spinning just off the inside for home between foes, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, edged away under a drive kept busy to the finish.
SCORESWHENHEWANTS four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner
home clear for the place honors. SHAMROCKED three wide in pursuit in aim of the front, advanced to stack outside the top pair and then the leader coming
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got let out spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. READY TO ESCAPE briefly in
tight along the inside as CHARGE AHEAD crossed over from the outside, dueled in hand inside of that rival down the backstretch and into the turn, began to
shake off that foe when confronted by SHAMROCKED at the five-sixteenths, remained in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in and yielded the front at
the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. AMERICAN RULE chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. CHARGE AHEAD lost his footing at the start,
recovered to duel from the two path with READY TO ESCAPE to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to back away through the latter
portion of the turn and was steadied briefly near the quarter pole before tipping four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG MOUNTAIN brush at break, disputed the pace from the two path while proceeding along the backstretch, cleared HIGH COMMAND as the half was
being completed and got guided over towards the inside route, showed the way thereafter being tailed by the aforementioned foe from the outside, shook
free late on the bend, settled in upper stretch and was given his cue, drew off smartly. PLAYWRIGHT underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, was put to
encouragement spinning slightly wider into the stretch, rallied for the place. HIGH COMMAND recovered in short order after stumbling at the break, was
along the inside route contending with the winner for the a good portion of the opening half, flip-flopped paths with that rival at the top of the turn, thereafter
stalking that opponent from path two, tipped out three wide into the lane, failed to keep pace, lugged in with approximately a sixteenth later, held on just long
enough late to salvage the show. BEBE BANKER travelled four wide on the turn, was one path farther off the rail for the drive home, made no headway in
the final furlong. TEN TWENTY NINE brushed at the break, departed the backstretch from the two path, got sent out into the five path from upper to
midlane, made no impact. BEACH ACCESS quickly tucked into the two path, stepped into the lane slightly wider, had no rally. WHISTLING BIRDS forwardly
placed three wide on the turn, folded. BIG THICKET was gradually worked over to the rail, was still on it when put to the whip past the three-eighths pole,
angled five wide into the stretch, had no rally. TIERGAN lost his footing springing from the starting gate, travelled four wide on the turn, wandered into the
seven path backing away down the stretch. CENTRIST three wide entering the turn, was moved out five wide exiting it, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ARTHUR'S HOPE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand from the two path lightly coaxed along, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive coming under threat a furlong from home, repelled the challenge digging in and holding well to inch away at the end. T LOVES
A FIGHT three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down swinging three wide into upper stretch,
rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home latching on the leader to the outside loosely between foes, dug in under a drive but as ultimately rebuffed to
the finish. AVEENU MALCAINU shied out at the start filling the space left vacated by the breaking outwards CELTIC CHAOS, chased two to three wide
down the backstretch from just off the pace and then three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a bid a furlong from home, dug in under a drive flattening out in the late stages while clear for the show honors. THE
CARETAKER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five
wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. MY BOY TATE got brushed at the start by CELTIC CHAOS and was pinched out of
his lane against T LOVES A FIGHT, chased four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CELTIC
CHAOS broke out at the start brushing MY BOY TATE and pinching that rival out against T LOVES A FIGHT, chased just off the inside from near the rear
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
GIPSEY SORCERESS sat prominently placed right from the get-go, tracked the front runners while spaced at a slight distance from off the inside route, was
moved to the outside as the half was being completed, was under urging swinging three wide into the lane, joined the pace dispute a few strides later,
out-fought a pair of opponents to her inside over the course of the next furlong then kicked well clear. LOVE ME TOMORROW off the inside throughout,
took up the chase from path four on the turn, was worked into the six path from upper to midstretch, rallied down the center of the strip to procure the place.
MENZAMENZ prompted the pace from the two path, got cued up spinning slightly wider into the stretch, vied from between foes from around the
three-sixteenths pole to around the sixteenth pole, saw the winner take charge then lost the place late. MORE DIAMONDS remained along the rail arguing
for the top, got turned loose for the drive home, fought as the innermost of three from upper to deep stretch before weakening. BARKER LANE shouldered
the right side of the gate after becoming fidgety just as the field was about to released, was quickly moved inward and spotted in the two path, stayed on it
during the run around the bend, went approximately five wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response. MAYBE A RAINBOW was eventually steadied
after shying away from another at the start, made it onto the inside route, took it while racing on the turn, was getting roused two wide into the stretch, tipped
a bit wider late, made no impact. REWARDED forwardly placed three wide for a half, gave way. MAQUA DAWN travelled three wide on the turn, wandered
out seven wide racing down the stretch lacking an offering. DERBY DOLL was hesitant at the start, went over to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, cut
the corner under a drive, failed to fire appreciably. BIG BOUNTY three wide entering the turn, was steered one path wider leaving it, tired.
