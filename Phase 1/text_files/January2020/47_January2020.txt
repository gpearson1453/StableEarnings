UNFADING BEAUTY brushed with a rival at the start, was reserved towards the rear oft the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was roused near
the quarter-pole, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed whip in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. PI
broke near the back of the field, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked while three wide into the stretch,
chased TOUGH KICKS under a drive into the final furlong, gained the lead into the final sixteenth but was denied by the winner while able to get the place.
LITTLE SNIP was rated just off the pace then three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch now asked for run, chased the leader on the outside into
the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole but was outfinished while able to get the show. TOUGH KICKS showed good speed, crossed over while
going to the front, set the pace on the inside, was put to a drive in upper stretch, led until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but just held the last spot in
the superfecta. BRENDA'S AN I FULL was restless in the gate then hustled from the start, raced just off the pace in the pocket after being beaten to the
front, drafted inside on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, had an opening between horses while chasing on the incorrect lead, lacked
the acceleration to go through the opening, steadied when the gap tightened up around the sixteenth-pole then was also out-kicked. BACK PAGE STAR
brushed with a rival at the start, was reserved at the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn, was roused late on that bend, came five wide into the
stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and reached her best stride too late. SABE MARCELETE moved out outside the half-mile pole,
settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused while four wide into the stretch, came under the whip near the three-sixteenths, remained on
her inside lead until near the furlong marker and failed to rally. Following the race, the rider of BRENDA'S AN I FULL claimed foul against PI for alleged
interference in the stretch. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish. (Rail at 14 Feet)

LOOKING FOR BULL went around the first turn in the two path, was taken in hand late on that bend, settled more kindly early on the backstretch then came
under urging inside the five-eighths, went three wide while ridden along on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong
and closed well to get up late. CHEAP SHOT went three wide early on the first turn then shifted out four wide behind the leader midway through that bend,
moved back to three wide before entering the backstretch, stalked the pace outside of the leader, turned up the pressure in the three path on the far turn,
took the advantage inside the five-sixteenths, edged clear while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead at the furlong marker, led
into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. GUITAR KING was hustled from the start then taken in hand while in the two path on the first
turn, settled off the pace under some restraint, moved out leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the far turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths,
chased the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and weakened while held together to the wire clearly best of the rest. EL HOMBRE bumped with
a foe into the first turn, went five wide under tight restraint on that bend, tugged hard at the bit and pulled his way forward onto the backstretch, was rated
just off the pace on the outside, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, chased three wide into the stretch and capitulated. QUISTY BOY ducked
out at the start, moved up into the first turn, went four wide early on that then then dropped to the two path while moving to a clear lead, set the pace down
the backstretch, was asked at the seven-sixteenths, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired. TWO DATE was rated just off the pace on the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged along while saving ground on the
far turn and came up empty. I DON'T FLY COACH brushed with a rival at the start, bumped with EL HOMBRE into the first turn then checked between
horses, went four then three wide on that bend, settled well behind the rest of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path and was no factor. PEACE LANE
BOY broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was taken under a strong hold late on that bend, settled outside on the backstretch, fell well
behind while four wide on the far turn and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
SUZIE'S DREAM settled at the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole, angled out while still on her inside lead in
upper stretch, switched to the proper lead and leveled out into the final furlong, rallied on the outside and closed fast to get up late. MR. AL'S GAL showed
good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat from DIAMOND CUTTER at the three-sixteenths, disposed of that foe into the
final sixteenth but was denied by the winner while clear for the place. DIAMOND CUTTER settled on the outside, ranged up while four then three wide on
the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole-, made an outside bid in upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth then was outfinished
while able to get the show. PLAY UNIFIED chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a strong drive into the final
sixteenth and lacked the needed kick. SAINTS N MUSKETS was well placed just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the
turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. I'LL TAKE IT ALL settled off the pace, checked between horses while three wide
early on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
SPIDER DANCE broke a bit slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear of the field, came under
urging leaving the backstretch, advanced three then four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the
three-sixteenths then moved clear in the final furlong under steady urging. N. D. FREE went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged
along passing the half-mile pole, started the far turn in the two path then angled five wide, dropped to four wide under urging near the five-sixteenths, made
a bid into upper stretch, took a brief lead at the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner shortly thereafter, drifted out near the furlong marker then
was straightened by the rider and was outfinished while well clear for the place. FASHION ISLAND raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled
towards the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, moved out near the furlong marker then again around the sixteenth-pole and was along for
the show. RUBY SIOUX steadied while in tight between horses after the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while
four then three wide on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. ROMANI went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace,
saved ground under urging on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then drifted in and had nothing left. LADY CLEOPATRA was hustled to the lead,
raced in the two path on the first turn, set the pace while getting pressure to her outside, lost the lead while urged along against the rail on the far turn,
dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. DESTINY'S DARLING raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside,
vied in the three path on the far turn and faded.

LOGICAL MYTH broke just a step slowly, settled into stride toward the rear racing a path removed from the rail through the first turn, dropped back to last
leaving the backstretch, was encouraged three furlongs from home, shifted to the four path while beginning to pick it up past the five-sixteenths, continued
widest of all six deep by the top of the stretch, took aim, struck the lead under a drive a sixteenth out and edged clear. SINGAPORE FLASH bobbled just
slightly at the start yet still broke in front, switched outside the leader early on the first turn stalking that rival two deep, advanced still two wide to challenge
by the quarter pole, was delayed in switching to the appropriate lead but having done so was just clear by the furlong marker, was outkicked by the winner
but clear of the rest. CONATIVE settled at the rear off the fence in about the two to three path, came under urging four wide through the far turn, kept on in
the lane. PONY UP was within range of the leading pair while carried four wide on the first turn, shifted in a path entering the far turn and was asked for
more but could only run on evenly in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MERLIN'S SONG tucked in entering the first turn racing toward the back,
advanced inside up the backstretch, came out to the two to three path near the five-sixteenths, leveled off in the drive. COWORKER caught two wide into
the first turn but soon cleared and was able to shift in dictating terms along the rail, was challenged on the far turn, kept on till inside the final furlong then
faltered and faded. TOM MANAGEMENT switched off the inside racing in the three path inside a foe just back of the leading pair through the first turn,
steadily dropped back and faded. (Rail at 14 Feet)

Footnotes
MINE MY TIME stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased the runner-up determinedly into the final sixteenth and got
up in the shadow of the wire under strong urging. RUNAWAY WIND was hustled while away alertly, set the pace in the two path, responded well when
asked in upper stretch, led gamely until the final two strides but was denied while well clear for the place. COOL QUARTET was bumped at the start and
forced into another rival, settled off the pace, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. LAUGHING BOBBY bumped with a rival at the start, was rated under a strong hold,
dropped back along the rail while let out on the turn and came up empty. DJINN OF DJIBOUTI broke out then bumped soundly with a foe while also
bumping with another rival, settled near the middle of the field, was urged along in the two path on the turn and also came up empty. V MAN bumped
soundly with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the turn and failed to respond. TREBULSKI was bumped hard on
both sides at the start then checked sharply while pinched back, spotted the front many lengths, went two then three wide early on the turn, angled five wide
late on that bend and failed to threaten. ASHLEE'S REWARD settled on the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
was no factor.

three then four wide early on the far turn then moved to five wide late on that bend, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed fast to make a bid into the final
furlong and proved best under strong urging. RELUCTANT WARRIOR contested the pace on the inside of a rival while near the rail, came under a drive in
upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. IBEAM brushed with a foe at the start, went around the first turn
in the two path, was well placed just off the pace under restraint, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased under the whip
while lacking optimal room behind the leaders from the three-sixteenths to the sixteenth-pole, altered out a path or so at that point then finished willingly to
get the show. EATORBEEATEN went clear early, lugged out six wide into the first turn then dropped to the four path, contested the pace on the outside,
vied in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then lost the show. ALAN'S

chased into upper stretch, made a bid into the final furlong but weakened. CHARLIE HOSS bumped with a rival into the first turn, went three then two wide
on that bend, was reserved off the pace, went four wide while roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. OUR

with a rival at the start, bumped with foes on both sides into the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled towards the back, went around the turn in the
