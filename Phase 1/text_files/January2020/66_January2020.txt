Footnotes
ONE STOP SHOP was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
quickly opened a clear margin and was ridden out to the wire. SKY DEFENCE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, could
not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid to gain the place. IRON BRITCHES was away in good order to duel for the lead with
RECORD YEAR while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner and gave way late for the runner-up award. CAROUSE lagged early, raced
three-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. CHEST CANDY raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early speed, raced
five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. TANZANITE chased the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
quarter and weakened in the drive. RECORD YEAR broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with IRON BRITCHES and weakened after going six
furlongs.

Footnotes
PACK 'N GOLD sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held off the closing FULL OF
DRIVE late. FULL OF DRIVE broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was gaining on the
winner late. SWITCH BACK chased the leaders from the inside throughout, could not gain on the top pair in the drive but finished well to hold the show.
SOUTHERN FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with some late energy. DIABOLICAL TIME showed no early
speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. QUIEN ES raced off the pacesetters early, dropped back slightly nearing the
five-sixteenths, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. SANDIA'S BEAT showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened.
SEA MERMAN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, was eased into the stretch, bled outwardly and was vanned off.

INDY WAY was off slow, lagged early, advanced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and closed with a late rush to be up in the
closing yards. SURF N DELMAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid with a furlong to run, vied, led late
and just missed. JEWEL OF NAVARONE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the
leaders in mid-stretch, vied and finished willingly. DRINKIN FIRE WATER was away in good order to press the pace of WILD CHEROKEE ROSE while
racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths pole, vied and gave way grudgingly late. MAIL MAN M G pressed the pace from the
inside and gave way through the final furlong. STACKING ROCKS settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. PANTHER
MOON lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, checked from falling foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole and did not menace. WILD
CHEROKEE ROSE broke sharply to set the early fractions, dropped back after going three furlongs, clipped heels, fell and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ADORABLE BRITTANY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide from between foes, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held sway to the wire.
SHAKURA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. SPECIAL WINGS raced off the pacesetters early,
advanced five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. CURL raced off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, drifted out approaching the stretch and failed to gain late. BET IT ALL was away in good order to press the pace while racing
four-wide and gave way gradually after going a half. MY LITTLE RIVER disputed the pace with the winner from the inside and weakened through the final
furlong. W F LA VENADA raced off the leaders from the inside throughout and weakened in the drive. HOMEMADE LOVIN lacked early foot, saved ground
through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to offer a bid. SOUTHWESTERN SPICE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and did not threaten. FOOT LOOSE N FANCY lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ARANZA LARK showed no
early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. BACK IN THE DAY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and
did not menace.
