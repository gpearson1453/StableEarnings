Footnotes
LOOKIN BACK AT IT went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace near the inside, moved to the two path around the five-sixteenths, responded
well when asked after turning into the stretch, was put to the whip while under threat from the runner-up at the furlong marker, disposed of that foe into the
final sixteenth and drew off under steady urging. WASNT JOKING brushed with a foe while last to commence then was hustled, went four wide on the first
turn, settled outside in the second flight, went around the far turn in the four path, passed the five-sixteenths under coaxing, was roused at the quarter-pole,
chased the winner on the outside under the whip into the final sixteenth then proved no match while clear for the place. GUESTAR went five wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was ridden along while five then six wide on the far turn, advanced into a reasonable striking position into upper stretch but
lacked the needed response while best of the rest. HONDURAS GIRL settled on the inside, moved closer while urged along midway down the backstretch,
saved ground while ridden along on the far turn and came up empty. MY HALF checked badly nearing the first turn then for a few strides thereafter, went
around that bend in the three path, settled at the back, saved ground under urging on the far turn and was no factor. BULLETSANDBOURBON went around
the first turn in the two path, was well placed in the second flight, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the far
turn, spun four wide into the stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. INTERSLEW dropped from five to four wide early on the first
turn then moved to three wide later on that bend, settled off the pace, was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and also failed to respond.
BOBBIES REASON was fractious in the gate, brushed with a foe at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path on the far turn, dropped back under the whip into the stretch and faded. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO THE
SENSOR BEING TRIPPED EARLY

Footnotes
J ROB broke very fast and went straight to the lead, set the pace in the two path under pressure to the outside from LAFITTE'S FLEET, was asked outside
the quarter-pole, brushed with the aforementioned foe outside the three-sixteenths, came under the whip shortly thereafter, responded well in the final
furlong and prevailed under vigorous urging then was vanned off after returning to the winners circle. LAFITTE'S FLEET tossed his head as the gate opened
and broke a step slow, prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, was asked on the far turn, came under the whip in upper stretch, battled outside
the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the place. RANCHO BARGO broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider,
raced in the two path early on the first turn then dropped to the inside, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch,
was ridden along in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and came up empty while clearly best of the rest. SOAR LIKE AN
EAGLE went three wide on the first turn, settled under some urging, was ridden along while three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. STRENGTH
went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear off the field, dropped far behind while moving from four to six wide on the far turn and showed little.

VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) saved ground on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused while three wide
into the stretch, moved out under a left-handed whip around the three-sixteenths, rallied on the outside, switched back to his inside lead when crossing the
gate tracks at the furlong marker and closed strongly to win going away. FROST OR FRIPPERY broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, was well
placed just off the pace on the inside under some restraint, drafted along the rail while guided around the far turn under a bit of extra left rein pressure,
responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able
to get the place. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF moved in while going to the front, raced inside on the first turn, set the clear pace, went around the far turn in the
two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the show. MR. PAPILLON went three wide
on the first turn, settled towards the back, went two then three wide on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive around the
three-sixteenths and finished willingly to just miss the show. RESILIENT RICK went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged

Footnotes
JADED ROSE was well-placed stalking the leader three to four deep into the turn, edged closer through that bend, was overtaken by an outside rival in
PEGGYS QUEST in upper stretch, kept on under steady but moderate handling to get up inside that foe at the wire. PEGGYS OUEST broke a step slowly
then bumped the outside foe and steadied slightly at the start, was encouraged toward the rail soon after the start in behind the leaders mid-pack, came out
a path leaving the backstretch to enter the turn two deep, continued three then four wide on that bend urged along past the quarter pole, struck the lead in
upper stretch and was clear but was outfinished. CHERRY TWIST tracked the leaders from inside early, came out a path past the furlong marker to
advance by the tiring pacesetter, ran on evenly, and gained show honors from BEADSINTHETREES, who was bumped at the break, switched outside the
pacesetter as that rival shifted in after the opening quarter, continued to pursue two to three wide through the turn, lost show honors late. CARSON'S
PROSPECT was outpaced early racing off the inside, passed a rival from the four path as that one was taken up early on the turn, continued three to four
deep on that bend, shifted in once in the stretch and continued to gain mildly. COHENSCOLLEGEFUND, mildly coaxed forward and shifted in after the
opening furlong to set the pace into the turn, was challenged leaving that bend saving ground near the rail, faltered in upper stretch and faded. STELLA'S
SURPRISE raced outside foes five then six wide on the turn and failed to rally. JACKIE EMS PAL chased from off the inside going four then five wide on the
turn and inside a foe leaving that bend, was empty in the stretch. KENTUCKY STEAL went wrong early on the turn, was pulled up past the three-eighths
pole and vanned off.

the far turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole then came four wide into the stretch, shook clear when put to a drive around the three-sixteenths,
responded well in the final furlong and held under strong urging. DADDYMADEMEDOIT went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was

moved in early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, shifted five wide into the

drive in upper stretch and finished with late energy for the last spot in the superfecta. ALLONGE set the pace in the two path, was asked late on the far turn,

SKEET was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out behind horses at the three-sixteenths then
shifted further out around the furlong marker and finished with good energy for the place. HOLIDAY TIME was away alertly, tracked the pace on the outside,
was asked in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch, made a bid inside of the winner inside the three-sixteenths and was outfinished while able
to get the show. DANCE RHYTHMS was coaxed along off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive
in the stretch and was out-kicked then just missed the show. GREY SEAL broke out and was last away, raced on the far outside under restraint, moved in
leaving the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn, was roused while swinging six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. NOVO
AZUL set the clear pace, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead inside the
three-sixteenths and gave way. SENSIBLE MYTH chased the pace, made a bid in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch
and tired. MISS BIGLY settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. (Rail at 22

LA FEMME ROYALE bumped the outside rival at the start, attended the pace from outside then between rivals three deep into the turn, vied inside VOMBA
into upper stretch having dispatched the two inside foes, edged to the lead inside the final furlong, just lasted under steady handling. BEAUTIFUL TALE
tracked in behind the leaders from the three to four path up the backstretch, shifted in to about the two path entering the turn still last but one, gradually
swung six then seven wide turning for home, took aim still with a bit to do a furlong out, was gaining late but just missed. DIAMONDCOAT was
forwardly-positioned along the rail early, continued to track in behind the leaders from a path off the rail through the turn, steadied just slightly in behind
rivals past the five-sixteenths while lacking room, came out three to four wide at the quarter pole then another path by the three-sixteenths, made a late bid
between rivals that fell short. VOMBA just off the leaders early, advanced outside foes four wide on the turn to challenge, loomed a threat leaving the turn
but could not sustain the effort. COURT SURPRISE was bumped at the break, unhurriedly while trailing early going in the two path through the turn, came
into upper stretch three deep and ran on belatedly to pass foes. SOMEWHERE contended between rivals two wide through the turn, weakened in the
stretch. MIZ SHELTON vied inside saving ground through the turn, faltered in the stretch and faded. MISS IMPERIAL switched out in the early going racing
in behind in the four path, continued in close in the three to four path on the turn, faded in the stretch, was vanned off.

came under urging leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn, swung eight wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the place.
VACATION LOVER broke out at the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace. came under urging in the three path on the
far turn, was carried six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished willingly but lost the place while able to get the show. ZACHRY
was well placed just off the pace on the outside, came under some urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed kick.

around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. BALLYHACK went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused while

around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, drifted five wide into the stretch under a

Footnotes
ALMA DERBY bumped hard with a rival at the start then was taken up, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch, drifted out while gaining at the three-sixteenths then was straightened by the rider, closed well to get the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole then
moved clear under strong urging. SWINGING GALAXY showed speed on the inside of rivals then was eased back off the pace, chased in the three path on
the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, bumped with that foe while making a bid at the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished late while
able to get the place. PURE VALOR moved up to dispute the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear outside the five-sixteenths,
was roused at the quarter-pole then put to the whip in upper stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, came out and bumped SWINGING GALAXY just
after losing the lead at the sixteenth-pole and missed the place but earned the show. ROYAL GALAXY bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start
then checked sharply, spotted the front many lengths, raced well back in the field, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, drifted in
while gaining from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker, made his way to the rail in the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the last spot in the
superfecta. SOVOL settled well back the field, saved ground under urging on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker
and improved position. CLASSICAL DUBAI was recalcitrant behind the gate while reluctant to load, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on
the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. BALANCE DUE was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two then three path
and was no factor. MIRA broke out and bumped hard with a rival, contested the pace on the inside of PURE VALOR, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped
back inside the three-eighths and faded. LA BEAUTY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved in while settling off the pace, went around the
turn in the two path under urging, was driven three wide into the stretch, drifted in coming to the three-sixteenths and failed to respond.
