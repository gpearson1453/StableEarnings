Footnotes
ELZABE'S ON BOARD broke sharply, was prompted to dictate the pace racing a bit off the rail racing into the turn, went clear in upper stretch and widened
the margin under firm hand urging. THE SPIDER, off a step behind the leaders, shifted out three wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance,
lodged a brief bid in that path leaving the midway point of the bend, couldn't match the winner in the stretch but proved best of the others. ELVIS COLE,
urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. KILL SWITCH hopped a bit at the start, tracked off the leaders
racing in the four path to the turn, continued in that path through the bend and steadily faded. TAMPER tracked the leaders from out of striking distance
racing five wide into the turn, continued widest to the stretch and was no threat.

Footnotes
FARMINGTON ROAD, off a step behind the leaders, tracked off the first along the inside racing into the first turn, shifted out splitting foes after a half while
advancing through close quarters, steadily advanced on the leaders three wide racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage in uppper stretch and edged
clear under firm left handed encouragement. NOBLE EMPIRE broke readily to gain a narrow advantage between foes racing to to the first turn, went clear
into the backstretch, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin into the far turn, held sway to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. SUNSATION, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pacesetter on the first turn, was eased back off the leaders entering the backstretch,
shifted out on the far turn and improved position between foes late while no threat to the top pair. INDY RIDE tracked off the first flight outside the eventual
winner racing to the backstretch, continued three deep tracking the leaders on a widening margin into the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. DON
H, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of that foe to the second bend and gave way between foes
midway through that turn. HIGH THRESHOLD broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JUNCTION, prominent four wide, then three wide in attendance to the pace racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival in a protracted
skirmish to upper stretch, shifted out a bit under pressure in the closing stages but edged forward under strong handling. SUM OVERTURE, in touch with
the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was eased back out of close quarters leaving the gap to track off the first flight, continued three deep into
the turn while being prompted to advance, drifted out five wide in the closing stages while gradually closing the gap but couldn't gain even terms with the
winner. UNSPOILED MOMENTS broke slowly, raced unhurried near the inside early, gathered momentum entering the turn, swung out five wide racing into
upper stretch, then angled inwards in the closing stages while continuing willingly between foes. GIANT TRICK was urged inside rivals disputing the pace
from the outset, dueled inside the eventual winner in a long drive into upper stretch but yielded late. THE WAYNE FACTOR tracked off the first flight from
out of striking distance racing four wide into the turn and continued evenly in that path into the stretch. MONEY BROKER vied briefly between foes racing to
the turn and gave way. JAIDEN'S BEST dropped out early.

Footnotes
JOHNNY U broke sharply, shifted off the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, then continued in a protracted skirmish to late
stages, gamely holding the challenge of FAR FROM AWESOME under firm right handed pressure to prevail. The latter broke readily, angled inwards
prompting the winner's pace racing to the turn, pressed the issue to late stages and was just outfinished. YOUNG AMERICAN was rated to track off the
second flight in the opening stages, shifted out four wide while advancing on the leaders racing through the turn, gained striking position entering upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick. UNION GRACE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn and faded
into the stretch. KITCHEN POLICE tracked off the first flight four wide, then three wide racing into the turn while making some brief progress between foes
but gave way after a half. R HOT TWENTY'S settled near the inside racing to the turn and proved no threat. SMOKY BLUES tracked off the first flight
between foes in the opening stages, was held up momentarily in close quarters nearing the half mile marker and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
FOXY MISCHIEF, in touch with a rival shifting just off the inside prompting the pace in the opening stages, asserted herself to gain a narrow advantage
racing into the turn and held sway on a comfortable margin under some right handed encouragement. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT settled off the second flight
while angling inwards a bit in the opening quarter, shifted out gaining momentum in upper stretch and came through close quarters three deep between foes
to secure the place honors nearing the wire. CAUGHT UP IN YOU tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening stages, then continued willingly in that
path through the stretch while just outkicked for second. STARSHIP REINA, in touch with the eventual winner prompting the pace in the opening stages,
continued in pursuit of that foe to upper stretch, then weakened inside foes late. RUSSIAN ROULETTE broke awkwardly while hitting the gate, was urged
between foes, then angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders into the turn, but emptied out in upper stretch. THOUGHTLESS never seriously
menaced.

Footnotes
EMBOSSED was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards a bit to race just off the inside after a half, was prompted
to split foes three wide entering the far turn to advance on the leader, moved to wrest the advantage from that foe in upper stretch and went well clear in the
closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. CHICK'S SHADOW was rated between foes, then along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in
the opening half, shifted out nearing the far turn while advancing readily to gain the advantage, set the pace to upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner but
kept on willingly to prove best of the others. WHISPER SLOW, reserved along the inside while dropping into the last racing into the first turn, swung outside
foes racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final bid. TONAPITA tracked off the second flight between foes, into the
backstretch, came around a tiring foe on the far turn, then was urged along the inside into upper stretch but steadily faded in the closing stages. WOWEE,
urged to the lead along the rail, set the pace for a half and gave way abruptly once headed entering the far turn. SMARTY CAT, forwardly placed outside
foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the far turn and quickly emptied out.

BETTYB tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight in the opening half, advanced four wide on the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch while
being roused to challenge, drifted out under left handed pressure near midstretch crossing into the paths of CAPTUREMENOW and MORE THAN
GRACIOUS, but continued with a steady late bid to maintain the advantage under firm right handed pressure. BIG LIZ was settled off the field near the
inside in the opening half, angled out in upper stretch, split foes five wide when presented an opening nearing midstretch to bid for command inside the
winner but proved only second best. CAPTUREMENOW, reserved outside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders
five wide racing into upper stretch, was carried out by the winner midstretch into the path of MORE THAN GRACIOUS, was righted in the closing stages but
was outkicked by the top pair. MORE THAN GRACIOUS settled last to the backstretch, angled outside foes gathering momentum racing into the far turn,
angled six wide in upper stretch, was forced wide nearing the furlong marker while being taken up momentarily and had no final response. TIZ HER WAY
tracked off the second flight between foes to the second bend, shifted out racing into the lane, altered course nearer to the inside avoiding traffic midstretch
but had no final kick. DON'T FIGHT, urged to gain terms with the pacesetter three deep racing to the backstretch, attended the pace while pulling a bit
through the backstretch, was urged to challenge three wide on the far turn, was carried out a bit entering the lane and proved empty in the drive. NERISSA
tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. MIAMAYA angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in the
opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid along the rail entering the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. AMERICA'S QUEEN, urged to the

FORWARD MOTION tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out four wide racing into the lane while being urged to advance, was bumped near
midstretch but kept on with a steady late response to narrowly prevail under firm handling. SACRAMENTO Q settled last while angling to the inside racing
through the backstretch, shifted out while gaining position between foes in upper stretch, was urged to bid in close quarters three deep between foes making
contact with the eventual winner midstretch, altered course abruptly to bid inside TONY while bumping HALFBACK approaching the sixteenth marker, came
through close quarters while shifting to the rail to challenge for command and just missed. TONY tracked just off the first flight outside foes in the opening
stages, advanced three wide on the turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage midstretch, shifted about under pressure in
the closing stages and was just outkicked by the top pair. DOUBLE DEEP tracked the leaders between foes in the opening stages, angled out five wide
racing into upper stretch and finished evenly in that path late. NICK THE CARDSHARK, urged inside rivals disputing the pace, dueled for command into the
turn and gave way into upper stretch. HALFBACK, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes to
upper stretch, was bumped while being forced in by SACRAMENTO Q nearing the sixteenth marker and quickly gave out. FRONTLINER was steadied
avoiding GATE CREW in the opening stages, shifted out tracking off the second flight to the turn but never gained contention. GATE CREW broke readily to
gain terms with the first flight but quickly dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN
BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

FLUGEL BINDER tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn, angled out five wide entering the lane and continued with a
steady late bid to narrowly prevail under firm left handed pressure. ESTILO TALENTOSO, steadied out of tight quarters at the start, settled outside foes
racing to the turn, was prompted to advance splitting foes while angling sharply to the rail racing into upper stretch to challenge for command inside the
leaders but was just outkicked. R LOVELY JULZ ducked inwards bumping RITA OF CASCIA, was urged to the lead racing off the rail into the turn, dueled
between foes three wide into upper stretch and weakened late. HIFALUTIN, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn, was
fanned six wide into the stretch and had no late kick. COSI MOMOSI, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced in that path to
press the issue into the lane but proved empty late. RITA OF CASCIA, bumped soundly, then squeezed between foes at the start, tracked off the second
flight near the inside and continued evenly into the lane. RISEN CHANGE, off slowly, then cut off at the start, settled while switching outside foes into the
turn but passed only tiring rivals. CSILLA was settled outside foes to the turn, was fanned six wide into the lane and proved no threat. COMMANDER OF
DEATH stumbled at the break bumping HIFALUTIN, angled to the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in the lane but had no rally. MERMAID
KISSES angled inwards while prompted to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into the lane. COLA,
bumped soundly at the start, never gained contention. LADY FIRE ducked outwards at the start cutting off a rival while bumping COLA, was urged along the
inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way into the lane.
