Footnotes
BOUND TO GO off a bit slow to begin, sent for the front and went up inside to duel with MINIMAL MISTAKE, battled into the lane and drew clear in the late
stages. MINIMAL MISTAKE broke well and gained the lead, dueled from the outside into and around the turn, pressed from the outside into the lane but was
no match for the winner late. THE SUPPLY PROGRAM bumped repeatedly at the start, stalked two wide then moved over to the rail on the turn, continued
along the rail to the stretch and went evenly late. ARTCRILIC traveled near the back of the pack, outside a rival into the turn, drifted out around the bend
and improved position. BERRACO outside rival early then off the rail into the turn, angled to the inside and saved ground into the stretch but failed to
summon the needed rally. EL REGALO F G broke out and bumped repeatedly at the start, traveled along the inside, came three wide into the stretch and
weakened.
