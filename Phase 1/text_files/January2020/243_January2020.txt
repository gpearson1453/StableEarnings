Footnotes
DREAMS OF VALOR sent along four wide early, angled in and set the pace inside, responded when challenged leaving the backstretch, kicked clear again
and held gamely under urging. MURAD KHAN (FR) stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail, continued alongside a foe into the stretch and went on
willingly late but could not quite catch the winner. WINNING ELEMENT broke a bit slowly, chased outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch,
continued alongside a foe leaving the second turn, came out into the stretch and edged a foe for third. TRUTH SEEKER saved ground stalking the pace,
came out into the stretch and was edged for the show. SEVEN SCENTS angled in and chased outside a rival then between horses leaving the backstretch,
found the inside on the second turn and lacked the needed rally. ORDER AND LAW settled inside and saved ground off the pace, came out into the stretch
and could not offer the necessary late kick. CAPTIVATE stalked inside then just off the rail, bid outside the winner on the backstretch, angled in and stalked
inside again on the second turn and weakened in the drive. HEARTFULLOFSTARS angled in and saved ground off the pace then went outside a rival on
the second turn, angled to the inside again in the stretch and lacked a further response. BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) stalked outside a rival then just off the
rail, came three wide into the stretch and also lacked a response in the drive.
