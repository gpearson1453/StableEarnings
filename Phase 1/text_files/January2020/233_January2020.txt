Footnotes
BIND ME UP raced within striking distance, made a bid between rivals down the stretch, dueled to the wire and was just up. AMERICAN REBEL raced in
the middle of the pack, made a stretch bid, dueled and just missed. UNDENIABLY DEVINE lacked early speed, made a late rail bid and was outfinished by
the top two. I'M ALL MIXED UP broke slow, racing in the rear, came around the turn wide, rallied down the lane and made a big gain. CORRECT ANSWER
pressed the early pace, weakened and finished evenly. NINEONEONEPRAYER dueled for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn and tired
late. GOLDEN SMILES void of early speed, moved up on the inside, but was no factor. BEAR TOOTH PASS always raced near the back and showed little.
ST TERESA was an early factor and finished early. LADY HOPPER vied for the early lead and tired down the home stretch.

Footnotes
MIMI'S SONG went to the front, being challenged by MISS BILLIE K, dueled throughout and was just up. MISS BILLIE K vied for the early advantage,
battled throughout, dueled to the wire and just missed. COSTA SUGAR lacked early speed, racing in the back, rallied late and was gaining ground.
CROWNED STYLE raced in the back of the field, made a late inside bid, but was no factor. JEWELS OF SORCE raced near the back, came around the
final turn four wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. ARGUMENT WON raced within contention, behind the top two and weakened down the final
stretch. HARLANS WARRIOR raced in the middle of the field, faded and was no threat late. KINKY KIM raced near the middle of the pack and retreated.
KATELINE'S DREAMER raced within striking distance, behind the top two and stopped.

Footnotes
RESILIENCE OF LOVE was an early factor, dueling with PIERPONT for the advantage, drove clear down the stretch and won under steady urging. JUST
KISSING BUCK lacked early speed, raced between rivals around the turn, rallied down the lane and got up for second. PIERPONT dueled for the early
lead, dueling with RESILIENCE OF LOVE, weakened and got caught for third. OUR RAPIDASH broke a step slow, racing from the rear, made a late gain,
but was no factor. JADE STAR raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. ELITE RUNNER pressed the early pace, faded and raced evenly
late. STIHL HARBOR raced within contention, stumbled down the backside, getting in tight quarters, dropped back and was no threat late. PRIMETIME TIZ
broke poorly and was never close. B B SPECIAL pressed the early pace, saved ground and dropped back. REBEL GENTLEMAN raced within contention
and was finished early.

THAT'S D 'CAT stalked the leaders in the early going, slipped thru on the inside entering the final turn and drove clear. CRIDER CASH raced within
contention, came around the first turn four wide, angled inside around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MESETA
DIABLO lacked early speed, made a late rail bid and proved third best. SI FAMILIA raced near the back in the early part, came around the final turn wide,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. WEST VILLAGE raced in the back of the pack in the beginning and passed tired ones. BEN'S MAGIC STONE vied for
the early lead, steadied around the final turn, getting in tight quarters and faded. JUBAL dueled for the early lead and was finished early. SET HUT
challenged for the early lead, steadied around the final turn, getting in tight quarters and retreated. HOOK pressed the early pace, raced four wide around
the second turn and stopped. THE JOCKEY OF #5 BEN'S MAGIC STONE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #1 THAT'S D'CAT FOR

pressed the pace, took command, drove clear and was outfinished by the top two. PRIME HOOK broke a step slow, raced in the back of the pack, made a
late gain, but was no factor. MCLEAN raced within striking distance, was carried wide around the first turn, faded and finished evenly. SMOOTH WARRIOR
raced within contention, was forced wide around the first turn, weakened and lacked a late bid. HEAVY TRAFFIC broke poorly, raced in the back and
showed little. SAINT DANSANT went to the front, drove clear and dropped back. GONE ROMANCING broke a step slow and was never close. LOUISIANA
