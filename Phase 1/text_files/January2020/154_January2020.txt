the start, move up, stretch battle, missed. MALEFICENT QUEEN inside trip while evenly with a mild gain in the final sixteenth. VIDA LEVA EU outside
speed first turn, stayed well to the stretch, faltered. SWEET ROCK bothered at the start, no speed from the outset, made little gain. BAR RAG well placed to
the half, gave way readily thereafter. MISS VICKI showed the way to the half, caved and dropped back readily.

Footnotes
ROCK ON KITTEN with the pace to far turn, urged into the stretch and stayed clear under good handling. STOCK CHAIN just off pace to far turn, went to
challenge, stayed game for place. OUT OF THE BLUE bothered at the start, advanced quickly to far turn, garnered show spot. HOPPED UP raced evenly
throughout with no late kick when needed. REPAIR THE WORLD never seriously threatened. WALLET hustled along for the lead, set pace to quarter pole,
faltered. SPORTSTER never menaced. HYPNOTIST stumbled at start bothering rival, regrouped, dueled to the half tired. PRIVATE BOONE through after
half and dropped back. ONEJUMP finished at the half while never a real threat.

Footnotes
HORSEFEATHERS tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid three wide down the lane, was under a long drive late and edged
past foe in the final stages. BIG ISLAND chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid from the inside down the lane, was under a long
drive and outfinished in the final stages. EQUAL JUSTICE tracked the pace early, took over command, cleared the field near the quarter pole, was off the
rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. ROUGH JUSTICE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch
but flattened out late in the drive. AGAINST THE LINE raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. TRUE TO
DIXIE was unhurried early on, swung into the six path entering the lane with a belated gain in the stretch. TWINKLING KNIGHT steadied along the
backstretch and was no threat thereafter. GLORIOUS WEEKEND was never a factor. SUNDAY DRIVE was never a threat. WILL RUNAWAY was done
early. HOWARD ROARK was through early. IDAHO TORNADO had brief speed then stopped.

BIRD IN THE HAT tracked the pace early, took over command near the quarter pole, was in the three path into the lane, was under a long drive and gamely
prevailed in the final stages. THE FALCON raced back early on, fanned into the five path entering the lane, was bumped nearing the eighth pole, made a
bid three wide under a long drive, was up for place late but not enough to the winner. PEERLESS BROWN stalked the pace early, was in the three path into
the lane, under a long drive down the lane while between horses but gave in and lost place in the final stages. SUBLIMINALCRIMINAL was back early on,
raced along the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. DEERSLAYER raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, was bumped
nearing the quarter pole while making a bid but weakened late in the drive. OBIWAN chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faded late in
the stretch drive. PITCHING FAST set the pace for three quarters then gave way. MAGIC MICHAEL broke awkwardly and was no threat. BRONZE MEDAL
was through after a half. WISE SOLDIER had early speed then folded up. DATZA FIVE OH trailed the field throughout.
