Footnotes
NOOK quick to the front to set all the pace, shaken up through the stretch while kept to task and proved tons the best. JEWELISA saved ground to far turn,
took up chase but proved no match. SUNSET GABLES hustled from the gate with little response, showed no speed to quarter pole but race widest through
the drive for the show spot. I GOT IT chased winner to the half but leveled off in the stretch run. MEDDYBEMPS raced evenly with no response. HAUTE
PROSPECT never proved a menace at any pole. FOXY GATOR through after half, dropped back. COLLEENS STORM off tardy from the gate, never close.
