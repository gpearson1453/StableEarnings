JOOPSTER accelerated to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the turn and was only moderately
asked through the lane. MALIBU SUNSET gave chase well off the rail then angled to the six path while improving his position on the turn, though, had to
settle for second best. LITTLE PLUMBER gave chase three wide then faded into the lane. HE'S SPECIAL gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the five
path and showed little more. WALK TO FREEDOM set the pace most of the opening three sixteenths then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced
at the rail rounding the turn then weakened.

ALPINE MOON rounded the opening turn in the five path then stalked three wide into the backstretch, drew to even terms at the seven sixteenths pole then
drew clear past the three eighths, dug in under steady encouragement from the middle of the far turn and held on. RIGHT NOTION saved ground close to
the early pace then eased out entering the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dueled through the
stretch for second and was gaining on the winner. SINGINDOWNTHELANE set the early pace inside and was met at even terms nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back leaving the three eighths, came through the far turn in the three path then outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. NORTHERN HEAT settled off the pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished
evenly. TRUE PURPOSE raced in the three path the first turn then drew to even terms two deep while between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, but,
dropped back leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground early on
and showed little response through the backstretch, but came through the far turn in the five path and finished evenly widest.

Footnotes
STAR OF NIGHT raced three wide the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, moved to the front approaching the five sixteenths pole, was urged
clear midway on the far turn then drew away under a hand ride. C V'S CAMPFIRE raced in the four and five paths the opening turn, started a bid toward the
five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and had to settle for second best. HOW IS SHE came away a step slow and raced in the
four path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn six wide, got up for third mid-stretch but showed little more.
SHE'S RIGHT saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path but proved empty through the lane.
SECRET CASTLE stalked the pace four wide then challenged at the three eighths pole, but, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened into the
lane. THUNDER PUNCH raced with the early pace inside, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. QUEEN OF ANYTHING
raced off the pace and off the rail then showed little response through the backstretch. WALKNTHEPLANK was hustled along with the pace, dueled from the
three eighths pole then faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
GALLANOR stalked the pace three wide then bid leaving the three eighths pole, took over two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the
far turn and held on well under steady stretch encouragement. CISCO BAY settled back while saving early ground, bid nearing the quarter pole then angled
to the five path rounding the turn, finished evenly and was gaining a bit on the winner. WEEKEND FLYER saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, drifted out to make contact with Ramantical leaving the far turn then dug in to take third later yards. LANA rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure from the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the quarter, continued in close chase through the far turn but dropped back into the stretch
and flattened stride. JEAN GREY raced off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn then left the turn outside, showed only mild response
through the backstretch, came through the far turn in the seven path and passed some fading rivals. FIDDLER raced well off the pace and proved to be no
factor. RAMANTICAL settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path, was
bumped at the eighth pole and weakened. NO HONEY MONEY stalked the pace four wide into the first turn then faded through the backstretch. DAISY'S
STORM raced with the early pace two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole, gave way under a steady drive on the far turn and was eased in the
lane.
