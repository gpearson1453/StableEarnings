QUICK ENOUGH advanced three wide around the far turn. rallied past CAPTAIN FLINT and BEINFUN from outside through mid stretch and kicked clear,
then held off BUNDI BUNDI to the finish. BUNDI BUNDI bumped with ALL D' HYPE while breaking alertly, tracked behind the leaders inside, was bottled up
late on the far turn and into upper stretch, tipped outside for clearance after QUICK ENOUGH went past, closed steadily outside that one but ran out of
ground. SHANGHAI MOON settled in the second flight two wide for six furlongs, moved to the far outside for the drive and rallied for a share without
seriously threatening. BEINFUN prompted the pace two wide, dialed up the pressure challenging outside CAPTAIN FLINT around the far turn and into the
lane, but weakened past the eighth-pole. CAPTAIN FLINT crossed over to the lead after an alert beginning, set the pace inside for six furlongs, and
weakened on the rail approaching the furlong marker. EL GRAN CACAO raced three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing bid. ALL D' HYPE
took the worst of a bump with BUNDI BUNDI at the start and was slow to begin, trailed inside to the stretch and could not gain.

Footnotes
JERSEY JOE B took the lead at the start and led the way along the rail through early stages, held firm over challenger around the turn, roused for more
upper stretch, responded, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. STARSHIP APOLLO raced up close while positioned just off the early leader
through early stages, remained in steady pursuit for JERSY JOE B on the turn and into stretch run, was solid in response but had to settle for second best.
DESERT GENERAL raced in range along the rail through early stages, hustled along and gained position moving through the turn then kept along near
inside in stretch run and stayed on for share. TRAPPEZOID raced in the back three to four wide then put to a drive around the turn, kept under steady
urging in the lane, showed interest but lacked the needed response for impact. TIP SHEET hopped at the start then positioned forwardly to race in range of
the top two leaders, chased rivals around the turn then gave way.

HIGH NOON RIDER was unhurried early, advanced inside around the far turn, moved out three to four wide at the top of the lane, rallied under a drive to
take over outside rivals past the furlong marker and drew clear hand urged late. KING ORB saved ground in pursuit of the pacesetter for six furlongs, came
out to lodge a bid in the three-path through the furlong grounds and finished willingly. ALIEN INVASION gained a clear lead soon after the start, set a
moderate pace to the stretch, got outkicked through mid stretch and was back to fourth into the last eighth of a mile, and came back on the rail to get the
show. TROPICAT tracked the leaders early, ranged up to challenge outside ALIEN INVASION approaching the stretch, gained command in the two-path but
weakened through the late stages. DISCREET HEAT raced two wide on the turns, and failed to mount a threat.

MILES AHEAD held a slim lead in opening stages then cleared on top, repelled the bid from DUKE OF TIZNOW near the seven-sixteenths pole, held firm
around the turn then responded sharply when roused upper stretch, drew then ridden out in the final sixteenth and continued to pull away. CAPITAN FOFO
tracked along the rail in early stages, hustled along into the turn then waited briefly near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted out and raced wide in upper stretch
then switched in a few paths under right handed pressure and continued a steady effort to gain place. NEWYORK GIANT raced six wide through the
backstretch then switched in and gained three wide to advance behind the leader on the turn, remained in pursuit but was no match for the winner then
flattened in late stages and lost show. ANYWHERE ROAD lagged behind in opening stages and angled inside to save ground, urged along the rail on the
turn and into the stretch run and improved position. CHADS CHOICE hustled along in early stages, got in a tight and forced to check near the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost kick but pressed on through the turn then offered no late run. DUKE OF TIZNOW raced in striking range to briefly challenge
eventual winner near seven-sixteenths pole then failed to sustain bid and dropped back. ELECTRIC HEAT stumbled at the start, came away slowly, raced
off the pace and failed to move into contention. SEE THE SONG hustled along in range then steadied near the half mile marker, lost momentum and
dropped back. STRENGTH OF GOLD chased up close in the opening quarter then quickly retreated, allowed to ease up in stretch run then walked off.

Footnotes
BACANO followed the top trio saving ground to the far turn, inched closer approaching the stretch, moved to the two-path turning for home, lugged in while
moving alongside HERO UP in mid stretch, got corrected and drew away in hand. HERO UP sprinted clear early, rated along inside to the stretch, proved
no match for the winner entering the final furlong but held for the place. FAYEZ stayed in range toward the inside for six furlongs, moved out a bit through
the stretch and finished evenly. BEACH TRAFFIC raced four wide most of the way, and offered only a mild response to pick up a minor award.
TRACEABILITY stutter-stepped at the start, lagged well back early inside, stayed on the rail and passed tired horses. CUY broke slowly, trailed two wide for
a half-mile, and passed tired horses. HERO'S RETURN prompted the pace outside HERO UP, and faded after straightening away for the drive. ALASKAN
stayed in range for six furlongs in the three-path, and gave way. SERGEANT AZER went along in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, and could not gain
three wide nearing the lane. GARNETT hit the left side of the gate at the start, and was never prominent. MACHO D'ORO showed little inside. DIAMOND
DREAMER raced three wide, and dropped far back after six furlongs.

Footnotes
BLUE BUFF brushed with rival then bumped slightly a step out of the gate, raced between foes in the second flight going by the half mile marker, headed in
pursuit around the turn, cleared on top at the furlong marker then held firm under steady encouragement. FLAWLESS MOON got bumped a bit between
foes then tracked the top two leaders through early stages, prompted three wide around the turn, raced in aim at head of the lane, could not kick on with the
winner but produced a solid bid for second best. LITIGANT led the way in early stages then vied for the lead with SAINT LARNED around the turn, fought
back upper stretch then failed to match with the top pair but stayed on for share. UNCLE GREGORY raced in range along the inside, lost position mid-way
around the turn then shifted to the outside for the stretch run, kept on with some interest but needed more for impact. SAINT LARNED was forwardly placed
in opening stages then vied for the lead racing outside of LITIGANT around the turn, fought back top stretch then lost position, angled out and gave way.
SHE LOVE ME got bumped a bit at the start, lacked early foot and raced in the back then wide into stretch and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
CRYOGENIC had aim outside the leaders three wide on the turn, challenged outside CAPTAIN RON though the stretch, and wore that rival down late.
CAPTAIN RON set a pressured pace inside, fought back when confronted by CRYOGENIC through the lane but yielded on the wrong lead. HONOLULU
EXPRESS saved ground early, moved to the three-path turning for home and edged closer to the top two from outside late. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE was
outsprinted to the stretch in the two-path, and gained negligibly on the far outside. GRAN MALBEC broke open the stall door prior to the start, was hustled
from the break to press CAPTAIN RON from outside early, and gave way approaching the stretch. R BOY BODE chased inside to the quarter-pole, and
tired.

Footnotes
AWSUM ROAR raced in the second flight between foes in early stages, picked up the pace past the quarter pole and roused forward to race in striking
distance upper stretch, given cue to seize command near the furlong marker, widened to a clear advantage then switched in a couple paths and held firm.
VILARO vied for the lead racing outside of BAND OF ANGELS in opening stages and continued to duel around the turn, dug in when challenged by
AWSUM ROAR upper stretch then lacked the needed kick to move on with the winner. HIGH JINGO was forwardly placed along the inside, waited patiently
near the inside around the turn, commenced a two wide bid in tight quarters upper stretch, bumped into weakening BAND OF ANGELS then angled out and
kept on for share. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN lacked early kick and angled to the inside, saved ground around the turn then hustled up and angled out turning
for home, continued a three to four wide bid, had a mild improve but needed more for to threaten. GILDA F. bumped with foes out of the gate then hustled
up from the get-go, chased the pace around the turn then raced wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GLORY ROLL raced in range off the top two
leaders early on, flattened out near the furlong marker then offered no late rally. BAND OF ANGELS vied for the lead racing inside of VILARO in opening
stages, continued to duel into upper stretch, began to weaken along the inside then got bumped back HIGH JINGO near the furlong marker and dropped
back. DIABLO'S DARLING was fractious in the gate, got bumped between foes at the start then raced in the back and failed to move into contention.

OVERDELIVER pressed the pace outside NEW YORK STYLE, poked a head in front after six furlongs, and drew off through the stretch under pressure.
NEW YORK STYLE set the pace removed from the rail, got collared a quarter-mile out, moved farther out after OVERDELIVER went by, and saved the
place. GENTLE WARRIOR lagged far back to the stretch, shifted outside NEW YORK STYLE in deep stretch and was getting to that one late. TUNE IN was
urged to keep pace inside around the turn, could not do so and faded through the lane. BUENO BUENO BUENO gave chase outside TUNE IN as they
raced together around the turn, and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCE KHOZAN led the way around the first turn then set a pressured pace to the far turn, held a slim lead over BEYOND THE CALL then shook clear
turning for home, kept on gamely and held sway under a driving finish. LETS PLAY HARDBALL was rated off the second flight down the backstretch,
launched a bid and circled up closer around the far turn, stayed on with good response for PRINCE KHOZAN but could not reach the winner. BEYOND THE
CALL applied pace pressure to PRINCE KHOZAN down the backstretch then continued in aim around the far turn, could not move on with eventual winner
then lugged in near mid-stretch and continued a rail bid under left handed pressure. BIG TREASURE settled inside and saved ground down the backstretch,
angled out and hustled up late far turn and had a mild gain in the lane. BLING SEEKER steadied in the first turn then rated off the second flight down the
backstretch, put to pressure along the outside and passed a couple faders. STILL SCHEMIN raced four wide entering the first turn then rated off the top
flight and tracked three wide down the backstretch, prompted to move on near the quarter pole, failed to respond then gave way. RAPSTOREROCKS raced
in range along the inside to the far turn then failed to respond when called upon. EXPRESS BOY raced in the back near the inside, shifted to the outside for
the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. MOZANO raced between foes in the second flight down the backstretch, had no advance around the far turn then
faded in the lane.
