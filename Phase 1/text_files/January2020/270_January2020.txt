IXTAPA'S FINEST chased the pace to the turn, came three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive and wore down PASTORATE late.
PASTORATE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in to resist the winner despite not switching leads but could not hold. SIERRA SUNRISE was
outsprinted to the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. VACAVILLE SPECIAL had no speed, was three
wide into the turn, had to circle outside of SIERRA SUNRISE five wide to the stretch then also could not make an impact late. FELONY ONE tracked the
pace from the rail to the stretch, remained a factor to mid stretch then weakened. BABY'S GOT CLASS pressed the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the

GALLANT HEAT never far back, raced three wide on the turn, was pushed out by ROYAL CREED in mid stretch then responded determinedly and got the
nod. ZIPPY GROOM had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn, responded when set down for the drive and just missed. INTIMIDATE chased the
pace to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then had to check in traffic when ROYAL CREED drifted out in front of him but recovered to rally. ROYAL
CREED was on the pace outside of SIERRA DANCE to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch, drifted out then weakened. SIERRA DANCE
hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. TUSCAN WARRIOR tracked the pace early, was two
then three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. MESA JONES bobbled at the start, had no speed then saved ground but weakened in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
RAMONCITA LIGHT was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, responded despite drifting out to mid stretch then came back in
under right handed urging but dug in to be along in time. CIRCULODEGANADORAS prompted the pace two wide to the stretch, responded when set down,
took a short lead late but could not stave off the winner. LIVE IT WELL was chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, eased out for room and finished
willingly late. SHE'S IN LUCK broke a bit slow and had no speed, raced two wide on the turn then finished well inside rivals. SECRETLY PARANOIDE
hustled to the front and eased in, saved ground to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was giving way late. TIZ A RULE also chased to the turn, raced
two wide to the stretch then came up empty. HOPE WINS had no speed, saved ground on the turn but lacked a closing bid. TAPEZOID tracked the pace
four wide to the stretch then tired.
