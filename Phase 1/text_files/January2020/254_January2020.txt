EVEN THUNDER grabbed command early on and went clear after a quarter mile, set the pace in about the three path, was nudged along mid turn, opened
up under a drive heading towards the furlong grounds then was fully extended to prevail. THEYALLCOMEHOME drafted back off the early pace, edged up
between foes nearing the turn, angled out and circled five wide into the lane, leveled off to his best stride leaving mid stretch, switched to his left lead in the
final stride and had his surge just miss. EARNED IT angled out early, advanced four wide nearing the five sixteenths, was under pressure chasing past the
three sixteenths but came up empty. BLAME THE KIDS , off the pace and outside rivals, circled five wide into the lane but lacked a bid. LINDA'S NEKIA ,
towards the inside, gave way. INCORPORATE chased three to four wide and tired in upper stretch.

JUST FOR SPITE sped to the early lead, was well off the rail around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. HONORABLE PROFIT circled the turn, bid for the lead outside the winner near the eighth pole, was herded out by that one inside the eighth pole and
hung. BROADWAY TROUPER , checked in tight quarters near the five eighths pole, saved ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and flattened
out. NOW OR EVER was not a factor. BLESS THE RAINS , along the inner rail around the turn, was outrun. SIPIN ON BOARD , very wide around the turn,
was not a factor. MOLLY'S DOLLY , along the rail entering the turn, chased the pace, angled wide in upper stretch and gave way. An objection by the rider
of HONORABLE PROFIT against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
MONKEY'S MEDAL , well off of a contested early pace and three deep past the five eighths, circled five wide into the lane, shifted out wider while under a
drive leaving the three sixteenths, kept on determinedly under left handed rousing, took command in deep stretch and held firm. CORT'N ASONG disputed
the pace outside CAN HE SHINE while under some rating, moved to a short lead in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, dug
in when confronted leaving the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. PRIME TIME MAN , in the clear off the battling leaders, came
under pressure mid turn, moved up four wide into the stretch, shifted further out and closed in nearing mid stretch, bid between rivals leaving the sixteenth
marker and hung. HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS , off the pace while saving ground, eased out under pressure in the drive but lacked a solid kick. CAN HE
SHINE accelerated inside to a short early lead, set a pressured pace, lost command in upper stretch and faded late. SACRED WALK saved ground off the
pace and failed to menace.

AMEN CORNER saved ground disputing the pace around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, dueled inside BRIGHT DAWN through the stretch and
determinedly prevailed. BRIGHT DAWN , three deep around the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch, dueled outside the winner and just missed in a
game effort. ANNAMATED MOON showed speed between the top pair and failed to keep pace with them turning for home. SOUPER COHIBA broke slowly,
raced in the two path on the turn and was outrun. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE briefly chased the pace down the backstretch.

Footnotes
POSTINO'S SECRET advanced to the inside of rivals leaving the chute and joined WILKO LOVESONG to contest the early lead, took command after about
a quarter mile, moved clear heading to the turn, set the pace under some rating while off the rail past the three eighths, was guided further out when
engaged by NANA'S SHOES near the three sixteenths, exchanged a bump with that one when dueling near mid stretch, repelled the challenge to go clear,
drifted out and held sway under a steady drive. NANA'S SHOES settled five wide outside foes, ranged up five wide nearing the lane, came in when
threatening the winner past the three sixteenths, exchanged a bump while dueling in mid stretch, failed to match strides heading to the sixteenth marker,
switched over to her left lead and saved the place. RAVENEL , taken to rate early, moved up while saving ground past the three quarter pole, stalked the
winner mid turn, came off the inside entering the lane, loomed then was out finished inside the top pair. HOLA PRINCESS , in the two path and in range
early on, shifted in around the turn but lacked a rally. E LIZZY lost ground four wide while stalking the pace, was under pressure into the lane and faded.
WILKO LOVESONG vied three wide outside the winner early on and tired. MISSIN MAGGIE was outrun. DEAR CHARLOTTE lacked speed, raced five wide
around the turn and failed to respond.

LAWN BOY (GB) opened up soon after the break, set the pace near the rail, lost the lead near the sixteenth pole, battled back and was bumped late by
MAJOR FLIRT. MAJOR FLIRT stalked the pace, swung to the four path in upper stretch, gained a short lead near the sixteenth pole, drifted in three paths
under right hand whipping, just missed and bumped the winner near the finish. CRUSH IT saved ground around the turn and had a mild rally inside horses.
HERO'S HOPE circled the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and flattened. ROYAL CRUSADER , two wide on the turn, weakened. KINGSTON
PIKE , snugly in hand when shuffled back mid way down the backstretch, was not a factor.

Footnotes
UNEQUIVOCAL grabbed command inside of rivals leaving the chute, set a rated but pressured pace in the two path, sparred with AWESOME AGENDA
from the far turn to mid turn, spurted clear after being roused into the lane, turned away threats leaving the quarter pole, wandered outward and pulled away
while kept to a drive to about the sixteenth marker. PEP TALKING saved ground, eased out and edged up between foes leaving the three eighths, angled
out into the lane, gave futile chase past the furlong grounds but managed to save the place. ALL CLEAR , unhurried early while off the inside, commenced a
run leaving the half mile marker, circled foes six wide into the lane, loomed but failed to seriously kick on leaving the three sixteenths. QUALITY MATTERS
lacked speed and saved ground near the far turn, swung wide for the drive and passed tiring rivals. BLUE DANUBE had speed then was rated back from
between foes near the three quarter pole, dropped in to stalk the pace, got through along the rail to make a mild run in upper stretch, lacked a response
from mid stretch and faded. PATRIOTIC QUEST stalked four wide, was under pressure between rivals into the lane and gave way. AWESOME AGENDA
disputed the pace three wide outside the winner, stayed on to the five sixteenths and faltered. I GOT THE BRAHMS faltered.
