Footnotes
LALALI dashed to the front at the start, dueled inside NICE ADVENTURE around the turn in the two-path, shook away from that rival into the stretch and
was shown the whip under hand urging. NICE ADVENTURE dueled outside the winner around the turn, could not match strides into the lane but was much
best of the remainder. A BEAUTIFUL DAY had an inside trip, and rallied mildly on the rail. AZNAVOUR bumped hard with DE PURA SANGRA at the start,
raced three wide and lacked a solid response. I'M A GINGER was no threat four wide on the turn. SHELLPHONE broke awkwardly and was off last, and
was outrun four wide. CATALINA R was always far back. BELLA BIONDA gave chase in the two-path early, and was finished before reaching the stretch.
EMILIA STRONG steadied between the eventual winner and A BEAUTIFUL DAY shortly after the start, and was outrun inside. DE PURA SANGRE bumped
hard with AZNAVOUR at the start, and was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
LADY ARCHA raced off the early pace and moved in to race two wide late backstretch, hustled along around the turn and gained position then shifted out
wider under a drive, kicked in gear near mid-stretch and finished going away. DON'T GET KHOZY raced widest in the back through the early going, hustled
along five wide into the lane, finished with response and cleared place. JOPLIN took the rail position in opening stages and chased in steady pursuit, kept
on with response two wide at furlong marker then moved back inside and advanced to gain show. AFANDI vied for the lead out of the gate with GOLDEN
NOBLE, continued to battle back into the lane, was no match when the winner seized command mid-stretch then had no kick left in reserve and gave way.
MARCHING IN was forwardly placed and chased the top pair of embattled leaders, raced three wide in striking range around the turn, shifted out wider for
the drive and came up empty. MAGICGIRL raced in range under steady pressure off the top trio around the turn then failed to sustain bid in stretch run.
PROBABLY GRACE angled in and raced two wide leaving the backstretch, hustled along the inside around the turn, cut the corner and stayed on with
response upper stretch then emptied out in the final furlong. GOLDEN NOLE vied for the lead out of the gate with AFANDI, continued to battle for the lead
into stretch run then came up tired mid-stretch and quickly faded.

Footnotes
NAVASHA tracked JEANA'S GEM from the outset, closed in from outside approaching the stretch, gained command a sixteenth out and drove clear.
JEANA'S GEM sped to the early lead well off the rail, moved inward around the turn, could not fend off NAVASHA while drifting out into the final furlong, but
was clear of the rest. HAAFILAH shifted off the inside midway on the turn, and offered a mild response outside to pick up the show. CANADIAN SUNSET
broke out bumping FIRST IN COMMAND into SINGSONG BIRD at the start, lagged well back to the stretch, and got bumped by FIRST IN COMMAND late.
FIRST IN COMMAND absorbed a solid bump from CANADIAN SUNSET and was pushed into SINGSONG BIRD at the start, faded into the lane, then
drifted out bumping CANADIAN SUNSET late. WAJEEHA was taken outside up the backstretch, and was driven four wide on the turn with no response.
SINGSONG BIRD got bumped by FIRST IN COMMAND at the start, and was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE MOLLY sped to the lead at the start and raced under pressure from BIG BOSS LADY, remained comfortable and moved away from rival to take
clear command moving through the backstretch, was under some mild prompting around the turn and upper stretch then wrapped up and finished geared
down while clearly best. UNICORN SALLY settled in early stages then picked up the pace mid-way down the backstretch, gained position entering the far
turn and remained in pursuit into stretch run, was no match for commanding winner but stayed on with response for second best. MIDNIGHT BELLA raced
off the early pace then hustled along midway down the backstretch, gained position moving into the far turn and cleared the rest. POSITIVE POWER rated
off the top two leaders through early stages then lost position and weakened around the far turn. KISSES FOR TIZZY raced near the in the back along the
outside, remained reserved leaving the backstretch and offered no late run. BIG BOSS LADY hustled up and angled in two wide while forwardly positioned
around the first turn, remained in close contention of the eventual winner early backstretch then failed to remain in touch with rival and retreated entering the
far turn. JOSEFA saved ground and showed response in early stages then came up empty after early backstretch and dropped back while not persevered
with.

Footnotes
TRILBY was content to maintain striking range in the two-path for six furlongs, moved out three wide rallying into the stretch, caught HERE COMES JACKIE
from the outside a sixteenth out and edged away under pressure. HERE COMES JACKIE set the pace inside, shook off CHARLOTTE THE BRIT to get
clear turning for home, could not hold off the winner but was able to save the place. LOVELY LUVY was unhurried early inside, angled four or five wide
leaving the far turn, and closed with good energy outside the top two. NIGHT WATCH saved ground just behind the leaders for six furlongs, stayed inside
for the drive and finished one-paced. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT prompted the pace outside HERE COMES JACKIE for six furlongs, and faded through the
drive. CASSIDY'S SMILE raced three wide much of the way, and never factored.

PROSPECTIVE DIVA led the way in opening stages then conceded position to PAULA ANDREA, tracked up close just off rival then moved up the inside
turning for home, assumed command then stayed sharp in response and kept clear. PAULA ANDREA hopped in the air at the start then rushed up and took
over the early lead, continued on top around the turn, got collared by inside running PROSPECTIVE DIVA entering top stretch and stayed on for second
best. STRONGER KAT hustled along in steady pursuit and chased the top pair around the turn, continued a bid with interest in the lane and edged out foe
to take share. NOTE TO SELFIE got bumped then stumbled and dropped back at the start, hustled along and chased around the turn and into stretch then
got edged out late for show. SAMIS CAR was forwardly placed out of the gate then weakened off the early pace, saved ground and hustled along into
stretch run but had no late response.

SALSA'S RETURN was never far back, moved off the inside to the three-path going by the quarter-pole, caught YODEL E. A. WHO from outside a sixteenth
out and pulled clear. YODEL E. A. WHO prompted the pace outside SO LONG CHUCK, took over after six furlongs and drew clear, but could not withstand
the winner while clearly second best. EMPIRE POWER raced two then three wide around the turn, and lacked a solid bid while plugging along for a share.
LIL COMMISSIONER was forwardly placed outside early, came under a ride three then four wide on the turn, lacked the needed response and faded in the
drive. SO LONG CHUCK set the pace inside, got overhauled just before going six furlongs, and gave way. ROYAL COUP trailed throughout and dropped
far back in the lane.

Footnotes
CAJUN CASANOVA broke readily and raced on equal terms with MIND YOUR OWN BIZ in opening stages, vied inside of rival into the turn then shook free
nearing the quarter pole, turned for home two wide widening advantage on top, stayed sharp in response and finished going away under a strong hand ride.
IBERICO came away near the back then angled in to save ground, remained off the early pace moving into the turn then hustled up and lodged a four wide
bid entering the lane, remained in steady pursuit for the winner and cleared second best. AIN'T WASTING TIME was off to a good start and pursued the top
two leaders around the turn, continued a bid racing between foes upper stretch then flattened out but kept along for show. DEO FORTE lacked early foot
and raced three wide in the back, urged for response along the outside around the turn, raced wide entering the top of the lane and lacked the needed
response for late impact. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ broke readily and vied for the lead with CAJUN CASANOVA, continued to battle outside path of rival into
the turn, could not move on with eventual winner near the quarter pole then emptied out in the lane. HENRY'S WORLD advanced position and raced in
range near the five sixteenths pole then failed to sustain bid and retreated out of the turn.

Footnotes
COLOUR GUARD advanced four wide to join the leaders after a half-mile, battled outside rivals through the stretch, and prevailed while leaning in and
brushing with BENEFACTOR at the wire. BENEFACTOR bobbled and brushed with GET HAMMERED at the start, slipped through on the rail to join the
leaders passing the three-eighths, battled on the fence through a long drive and just missed while being brushed by COLOUR GUARD very late. FROSTED
GRACE vied outside BELLE TAPISSERIE early, continued to fight on through the lane between the top two finishers, and weakened in tight quarters
nearing the 70-yard marker. ROYAL URN moved off the inside approaching the stretch, and lacked a rally outside. BELLE TAPISSERIE dueled early inside
FROSTED GRACE, battled on between horses in the two-path around the turn as they were joined from both flanks, and gave way in upper stretch. GET
HAMMERED brushed with BENEFACTOR at the start, moved out four wide dropping back late on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch. AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF BENEFACTOR WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DONEGAL ACES raced two wide entering the first turn and took over the lead, set the pace down the backstretch racing three to four wide paths off the
inside, held firm around the far turn then drifted out wider upper stretch, straightened out under right handed pressure, turned back the bid from EIGHT
AIN'T ENOUGH and kept clear. EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH was rank at the start and steadied but managed to race in aim entering the first turn, was positioned
off of DONEGAL ACES and stalked four to five paths wide down the backstretch, was under a ride around the far turn, switched to the inside of DONEGAL
ACES near the furlong marker, stayed on with response, could not reach winner but finished clearly second best. PERFECT ENOUGH rated off the top two
leaders through early stages, launched a bid leaving the half mile marker, was no match for the clear top pair and churned on for share. SKYLINE VIEW
raced wide into the first turn, remained in the back and raced wide into stretch to no avail. WOLFPUB raced near the inside and not far back early on,
dropped back after the half and lacked further response.
