Footnotes
GUATAVITA stalked the leaders, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, took over and drew clear under urging.
SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE rushed up early, dueled inside for the lead, battled on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and earned the place spot.
BUCKY BE LUCKY raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane, steadied behind CONGRATS ANSWER at the top of
the lane, then rallied mildly. CONGRATS ANSWER dueled two wide for the lead, battled on the turn, shifted out after a left handed whip at the top of the
lane, then weakened. PLAY BY PLAY tracked inside in the early stages, chased inside on the turn and faded. MISQUILLO raced off the pace inside and did
not factor. GRACEFUL MONARCH chased outside and gave way.

Footnotes
VOLODINA broke slowly after a six minute gate load, was quickly hustled up to racing inside and just off the pace, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and
edged away. BUCKS SOME set the pace in the three path, resisted when challenged and gave way grudgingly. TIZ A DATE, just off the rail and just off the
pace, drifted out through stretch and weakened. TOMARIE stalked the pace in the four path, also drifted out and weakened. BEARING SECRETS, very
wide, had no rally. KEENEASABEAN, three wide early, angled in for the stretch run but was no real threat. SWEET BLAME, racing in the five path early,
split foes on the turn then tired. NANCY B offered a mild bid inside on the turn then gave way. TARA'S TALENT failed to be a serious threat.
SPECTACULAR MOVE, reluctant to load, raced wide and was outrun. DESERTED broke slowly, raced inside and showed little. DEAREST ELLA bore out
on the backstretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHANE'S JEWEL dueled three then two wide, fell back near mid stretch, came on again, regained the lead near sixteenth pole, began to edge clear and
then held on. DIG CHARLIE DIG, in the four path early, moved in on the far turn, split rivals near stretch, moved back to the rail and closed well. TRUE
BOLDNESS, wide and just off the pace, fell back mid stretch but then was coming back. TRUE BLUE raced wide and rallied too late. LONDON HOUSE,
broke sharply after yet another lengthy gate load, was two wide early and then was left with rail, opened a clear lead mid stretch, faded, and was eased up
final strides and it may have cost his fourth place monies. DROSSELMAGIC raced between foes early, moved to the rail and faded. E J'S REVENGE
dueled inside early, eased back slightly before a quarter then tired. GRIT'N'GRIND broke slowly then never threatened. RAGGY ROCKS broke slowly and
showed little. ARRIVE IN STYLE raced wide and tired.

Footnotes
WICKED AWESOME broke slowly, saved ground to deep stretch eased out and got the nod. PECAN PATTIE, never far back between foes, angled out in
early stretch, drifted wider through deep stretch, closed and missed. HERAWAY set the pace in the four path, held a clear lead mid stretch but couldn't hang
on. DREAMER'S MOON dueled for command between foes then tired. CORN OFF THE COB, bumped around on the backstretch, raced very wide and
failed to menace. SPECIAL INCLUDED quickly dropped back after the start, saved ground and didn't threaten. OLIVE KAT came in leaving the gate then
raced very wide. CAWAJA TIME stumbled leaving the gate eighteen minutes past scheduled post time then showed little. COLLOQUIUM drifted out on the
backstretch, dueled three wide then gave way. PRINCESS ARENI drifted in on the backstretch contributing to the crowding then never threatened.

Footnotes
FROSTY FRIEND, three wide vying for command, took the lead leaving the turn, was clear mid stretch then lasted. IZA ONE broke slowly, saved ground to
quarter pole, split foes, then moved out and closed well. TOO MUCH DRAMA broke very slowly, saved ground and closed. IWASBORNAWINNER, four
wide in top flight, faded through the drive. GRAND BLUE HARBOR vied for command two wide before weakening. ALEDA LUTZ, very wide, dropped back
steadily. GRAVEYARD SHIFT, in the four path, failed to threaten. TAYLOR'S BELLE broke slowly then showed nothing. VALID TREASURE set the early
pace just off the rail then stopped. MIMI AND CHARLEY stumbled badly leaving the gate and unseated her rider. MIMI AND CHARLEY RAN LOOSE ON
THE OUTSIDE AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THE OTHER RUNNERS.
