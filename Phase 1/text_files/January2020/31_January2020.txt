Footnotes
I DON'T WANT TO GO was bumped by GUSANO in the opening strides, set the pace down the backstretch, continued on the lead in the two path on the
turn while taking pressure from CATS VALENTINE to the outside, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, shook clear and held sway. THE DOGMEN
chased between horses early, was hard urged near the half mile mark to take closer position, improved in the two path on the turn, kept on under a drive in
the lane but could not get to the leader while drifting out late. DANCE LIKE KATIE chased three wide early, was urged three wide on the turn, swung widest
into the stretch, and chased on earnestly without being able to reel in the top two. CATS VALENTINE was sent to show pace, stalked inside of CAPTAIN
CARNEGIE down the backstretch, switched outside the pacesetter near the half and prompted two wide around the turn, proved no match from upper
stretch, and was all out to hold fourth while drifting out. OFF TO THE BEACH chased toward the rear three wide early, raced two wide into the turn, dropped
to the two path when he got room, chased inside down the lane but was outfinished for fourth. ROUL THE ICE settled at the rear, improved in the two path
on the turn, and passed tired horses under a drive in the lane. GUSANO broke inward and bumped I DON'T WANT TO GO, chased midfield, saved ground
into the turn, switched out past the three eighths to get around OFF TO THE BEACH, but had no rally in the lane. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE tracked the pace
outside of CATS VALENTINE early, continued tracking the leading pair between horses on the turn, was driven for a bid near the five sixteenths, loomed
three wide into the lane, but emptied out from the three sixteenths. POINTING AT PETE broke outward, settled near the rear, trailed in the seven path on
the turn and made no bid.

CRUSADER GIRL TOO broke inward and soundly bumped MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES in the opening strides, cleared to the lead, took mild pressure from
KARA'S ANGEL outside her on the backstretch and the turn, began to edge clear in upper stretch without being asked and continued to draw away with no
encouragement. REAL DE JALPA raced between horses into the first turn, settled to track inside of BRILLIANT ONE and REAL DE JALPA past the seven
eighths, continued at the inside of the tracking flight, saved ground through the far turn, could not go with CRUSADER GIRL TOO in upper stretch when put
to a drive but ran on a clear second best. KARA'S ANGEL jumped at the start, was pushed along to track the pace four and then three wide through the first
turn, advanced to prompt outside of CRUSADER GIRL TOO past the three quarters, continued to stalk outside her through the far turn, but was no match
between horses in upper stretch. BRILLIANT ONE raced three and then two wide between horses around the clubhouse turn, stalked between KARA'S
ANGEL and REAL DE JALPA down the backstretch, tracked outside REAL DE JALPA in the four path on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, and
chased on while proving no match. WILDWOOD SCAT chased toward the rear inside of LION'S WAGER early, was pushed along to improve while saving
ground around the far turn, switched four wide into upper stretch, but proved no match. ORIENTAL LADY settled near the rear, was pushed along for a bid
three wide and then two wide and improved to midfield in the backstretch run, was urged in the five to six path around the far turn, but lacked the needed
kick. LITTLE CHICK settled at the rear, raced in the three path inside of LION'S WAGER in the rear flight around the far turn, and was no threat.
MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES was soundly bumped by CRUSADER GIRL TOO in the opening strides, took up near the seven eighths, chased midfield, swung to
the far outside into the far turn, weakened in the six path around the bend, and was no further factor in the lane. LION'S WAGER raced two wide toward the
rear outside of WILDWOOD SCAT, continued in the rear flight outside of LITTLE CHICK in the five path on the far turn, and made no bid.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S MAGIC cleared to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the far turn, continued to make the running down the backstretch and in the two
path on the far turn, was shaken up into the stretch, opened up, and drew further clear under a drive from midstretch. AMERICANPERFECTION chased
inside of RISKY RISKY RISKY into the first turn, continued midpack down the backstretch and through the turn, while racing inside of TANNAH'BLU and
CLOCHE around the second bend, rallied under a drive in the lane and got the nod for place between horses. LAUNCH AWAY came away well but settled
to the rear inside of TANNAH'BLU and CLOCHE, continued unhurried into the far turn as that pair began to rally to midfield, saved ground around the far
turn, switched out approaching the three sixteenths, rallied, and lost the place nod three wide. BE AUTHENTIC stalked the pace inside of RISKY RISKY
RISKY, tracked between horses around the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, could not match GHAALEB'S MAGIC, tired in the final furlong, and was
caught late from both sides for place. RISKY RISKY RISKY raced three wide into the first turn, chased two wide around the bend, advanced to track the
pace outside of BE AUTHENTIC down the backstretch, continued three wide in range around the far turn, but flattened into the lane. TANNAH'BLU settled
between horses in the rear flight, advanced to the chasing flight inside of CLOCHE past the half mile mark, chased between horses around the far turn, but
could not sustain a bid in the lane. CLOCHE raced three wide in the rear flight, advanced in tandem with TANNAH'BLU to race three wide in the chasing
flight past the half, continued three wide around the far turn, and emptied out into the lane.

Footnotes
CAPERNAUM settled near the rear inside of BIRD KEY, was urged inside of foes in the three path on the turn, split horses under a drive into the lane,
switched four wide approaching the three sixteenths and drove clear from the furlong pole. GOOD SUGAR chased inside of IMPERIAL TEMPLE early,
advanced to track inside of JOSIE BOY well behind the leading pair on the turn, rallied up the inside into the lane, brushed with ENJOY THE JOURNEY in
upper stretch, proved no match for CAPERNAUM in the final furlong but finished best of the rest. TIZALADYBUG pressed the early pace outside of ENJOY
THE JOURNEY, dueled outside that foe on the turn, vied three wide between horses in upper stretch, proved no match for CAPERNAUM and was
outfinished for the place. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY settled at the rear, responded when hard urged in the two to three path on the turn, and kept on mildly
between horses in the lane. ENJOY THE JOURNEY set the early pace, dueled inside of TIZALADYBUG around the turn, vied between horses in upper
stretch and brushed with GOOD SUGAR in, and weakened in the final furlong. JOSIE BOY tracked the leading pair early, continued well off the leading pair
while racing outside of GOOD SUGAR around the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, but could not find enough to match the leaders. IMPERIAL
TEMPLE chased two wide early, continued between foes on the turn, and was empty for the drive. BIRD KEY settled two wide near the rear, was urged
three wide on the turn, and emptied out past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
STORMY PACIFIC settled near the rear, rallied three wide through the turn, went to a drive three wide in upper stretch, led approaching the furlong pole and
drove clear. DANNY B was sent for speed, set the early pace, dueled inside of HIGH HERO through the turn, was confronted on both sides by STORMY
PACIFIC and TRUE TEN in upper stretch, dug in, proved no match for STORMY PACIFIC in the final furlong but outgamed TRUE TEN for place. TRUE
TEN came away well and briefly pressed the pace inside DANNY B, settled to track the pace inside of VBREEZE and STORMY PACIFIC around the turn,
bid inside in upper stretch, loomed a threat approaching the furlong pole, but could not match STORMY PACIFIC and was outgamed by DANNY B for the
place. HIGH HERO raced near the rear in the opening furlong but was pushed for an early outside bid into the turn, vied on the lead outside of DANNY B on
the turn, and flattened out in the lane. VBREEZE chased toward the rear early, swung three wide into the turn, chased between horses around the bend,
came into the lane under a drive but lacked the needed kick. BUDDY BUD was slow into stride, settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the turn and
lacked the needed rally. CHARLIE IRISH was pushed for speed but outjumped, was urged between horses into the turn, weakened in the three path on the
turn and was no further factor in the lane.

Footnotes
IMA LITTLE KITTEN tracked the leading pair inside of COUNTRY ASSETS early, chased in the two path on the turn inside of HEY HEY, was driven up the
inside in upper stretch, shifted two wide, split horses approaching the sixteenth pole and rolled clear. JE SUIS BELLE set the pace, took modest pressure
from BONITA SPRINGS to her outside down the backstretch and while saving ground through the turn, stayed on the lead under a drive in upper stretch,
kept on gamely but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. HEY HEY tracked three wide between COUNTRY ASSETS and
DONTOUCHTHATDIAL early, chased two wide in the four path on the turn, swung three wide in upper stretch and offered a mild rally. CHAINMAIL settled
at the rear, raced in the five path on the turn, went to a drive inside foes in upper stretch, and improved mildly inside horses. DONTOUCHTHATDIAL tracked
four wide early, engaged the leading flight three wide on the turn, kept on outside of JE SUIS BELLE into the stretch but was unable to get to her, and
weakened in the final sixteenth. COUNTRY ASSETS tracked two wide early, settled toward the rear in the five path on the turn, was urged for a three wide
bid into the lane, but lacked the needed rally. BONITA SPRINGS pressed outside of JE SUIS BELLE to the five sixteenths, flattened out between horses
from there and had no more for the drive. TOKEN VOW settled near the rear, pulled up past the three eighths, collapsed at the head of the stretch and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
CODETOWIN bobbled at the start and came awkwardly into stride, chased near the rear inside of SHAKURR, took closer order in the two path around the
turn, waited patiently behind the leading line until DEMAND RANSOM emptied out just past the five sixteenths, split horses through the opening he left,
engaged outside of LEE'S LUCK, vied two wide, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. LEE'S LUCK was sent to outsprint DEMAND RANSOM to the lead,
continued to set the pace while pressured by that foe through the turn, carried a narrow lead into the lane, vied inside of CODETOWIN in midstretch but
could not match his strides in the final sixteenth. MIAS MOONBEAM settled at the rear, took closer order in the three path on the turn, sustained his rally
inside foes into the stretch, proved no match for the top two but kept on well enough for the show. SHAKURR settled near the rear outside of CODETOWIN,
was sent for a four wide bid past the three eighths, continued four wide in range into the lane, but proved no match for the leading pair and could not hold
the show. ONE WAY HOME came away well, settled to track the leading pair, shifted out and bid three wide approaching the three eighths, was hard urged
three wide in upper stretch, kept on between foes to the furlong mark but weakened. DEMAND RANSOM was sent for pace but outsprinted by LEE'S
LUCK, pressed outside that foe down the backstretch and into the turn, emptied out just past the five sixteenths, and faded. Due to a timer malfunction the
five furlong split was unavailable.

Footnotes
RACETOTHEFINISH cleared to the lead, dictated uncontested terms in the two to three path on the turn, was shaken up in upper stretch, got a few
corrective strikes in midstretch as she began to drift out but otherwise drew off handily. PRETTI XTREME tracked the early pace two wide, settled back
behind the tracking flight near the half mile mark, chased under a drive in the two path on the turn, came into the lane along the inside, switched two wide
near the three sixteenths to make her bid outside of CLASSOFSIXTYNINE could not catch the pacesetter but chased on well enough to hold off WAR
COLORS for the place. WAR COLORS settled toward the rear early, improved when pushed along to midfield into the turn, chased in the six path on the
turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied outside and missed the place. WHOVILLE settled near the rear outside EMILY LANE early, improved position
three wide on the turn, came into the lane between horses, was driven past the quarter pole, chased on but proved no match for the top three.
CLASSOFSIXTYNINE came in slightly in the opening strides, tracked the early pace inside of PRETTI EXTREME, tracked in the three path on the turn
inside of WARREN'S WISH, went to a drive inside horses in upper stretch, could not make headway on the pacesetter and flattened out in the final furlong.
EMILY LANE broke inward and bumped TAP'S LULLABY in the opening strides, settled near the rear, continued two wide in the four path on the turn,
floated four wide into the lane, and rallied mildly three to four wide in the lane past tiring foes. COLONEL ABY B trailed after coming slowly into stride, took
closer order through the turn, dropped to the inside into the lane, drove past horses in upper stretch and leveled off late. NO PASSING ZONE tracked three
wide early, took back near the half mile mark when WARREN'S WISH came in, raced between horses in midfield on the turn, began to flatten between
horses near the three eighths, drifted out into the stretch and was no factor in the lane. TAP'S LULLABY hooped at the break and was bumped by EMILY
LANE in the opening strides, settled toward the rear inside of EMILY LANE and WHOVILLE, continued near the rear in the two to three path on the turn,
was driven two wide in upper stretch but came up empty. WARREN'S WISH tracked four wide early, dropped in past the half mile mark to track two wide
through the turn, floated three wide into the lane and came up empty.
