ICATIRO off the pace off the inside, between horses in the turn, dropped to the rail when straightened for home, rallied up the inside brisk left handed urging
to prove narrowly best;. COACH ADAMS dueled up front in the two path, continued to vie into the lane, long drive while widest of the first flight, outfinished
in the late going. WHENTHEDOVESCRY dueled up front closest to the inside, narrowly showed the way through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly
while between rivals. remained clear of the others. ALWAYS broke outward, lacked speed while well out in the strip, raced four wide through the, staged a
mild rally to improve position slightly, never danergous. RIKER in the second flight while racing three wide, came up empty when called on in the drive. NO
FUNNY BIZ one paced while racing four wide. ENDER void of speed, angled out slightly to be three wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. YOU'RE
KILLIN ME last to leave, four out to five wide through the turn when trailing, remained back. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN forwardly placed early just off the
inside,steadily faded.

Footnotes
TOWN CHAMP with the pace the start, vied up front off the inside, vied between rivals through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, kept to
task. AGGRESSIVITY lacked early foot, steered out to be four wide midway on the turn, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. REELFOOT in the
second flight off the inside, in some traffic in the turn, roused, clear final furlong, outkicked for the place. GREATER CAIRO rank then steadied at the start,
advanced into and through the turn, angled out three wide into the lane, attempted to up in soon after, finished up evenly. CORRANA EN LIMEN vied up
front in the early going, weakened in the drive. TRASHTALKINYANKEE void of speed, three path through the turn, raced on the outside for the drive, lacked
the needed closing response. GOOD SUGAR void of speed, saved ground through the turn, made little impact in the drive. JERRY'S GOT ACES pressured
the early pace, gave way in the drive. NOT FADE AWAY four wide in the turn, remained always back. PROUD NATION steadily faded while racing three
wide.

Footnotes
FUTILE prompted the winner off the inside, fell back off that foe a bit entering the stretch, reengaged past the furlong marker, wore that same rival down
under steady handling. LEROY lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, finished well on the outside, too late. SENOR JOBIM
void of speed toward the inside, advanced the middle part, altered course to the outside late and continued to finish willingly. DRENA'S STAR broke on top,
showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, larger lead into the lane while continuing to save some ground, showed the way past the furlong
marker, faltered late. HERE'S CARLOS off a step slow, raced inside early, shifted out a bit in the turn, improved position while finding his best stride too late.
ST. LOUIE GUY settled off the pace, lacked a significant closing response. LOUDEN'S GRAY behind the early leaders, advanced into a forward position
turn, angled three wide into the lane and began to fade. P R RADIO STAR prompted the early pace outside, faded while four wide. SING HIM A SONG four
wide in the second flight, staged a steady retreat.

Footnotes
VICTORY ELEMENT with the pace from the start after breaking in good order, with the pace closest to the inside, shook clear entering the stretch,
weakened but managed to last long enough to gain the dead heat. MIRACLE HILL vied early off the inside and between rivals, fell back off the winner
turning for home, came again late to earn the dead heat. AQWAAM behind the first flight, saved ground into the lane, lacked needed bid between the top
two. BULLION forwardly placed from the start outside, five wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. DUBNATION broke out, bothered foe, raced
back toward the inside, improved position with some late interest. ATTAIN SUCCESS off the early pace while out in the strip, dropped to the rail early in the
turn, came up empty for the drive. NOLA WIN went evenly while four wide. BELMONT HILLS had nothing for the drive in the two path. ALEX'S STRIKE
fractious in the gate just prior to the start, bothered at the break, was not a factor. SONIC JET forwardly placed while racing five wide. CAT'S AMERICAN
PIE lacked speed off the inside, three wide turn, four wide into the lane, was outrun in the drive.

Footnotes
GUEST SUITE vied early inside, was taken back after a quarter, patiently handled the middle half, steered out three wide turning for home, closed with good
energy to be up in time. SNAPPER SINCLAIR vied early between foes, pressed inside, took over, shook clear, nipped late. NIGHT OPS unhurried early,
ranged up to a striking position four wide in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the final furlong. SKY PROMISE broke slowly, remained sluggish
in falling far back, began to advance in the second turn, rallied in showing some belated interest. REMEMBERING RITA vied early three wide and outside
the top two in the first turn, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, faltered in the second turn. CHRIS AND DAVE settled off the pace, had little for the
drive.

NO SHIRT NO SHOES in the second flight early inside, raced in the two path through the turn when within striking distance, set down for the drive, closed
with good determination to be up in the final jump. TWILIGHT FANTASY away in good order, pressed early, took over turning for home just off the inside,
shook clear soon after, enough left to last for the dead heat. BACKGROUND in tight then steadied just after the start, raced back and toward the inside, two
path into the lane, rallied through traffic to finish up willingly. DUST DEVIL lacked speed, three wide out of the turn when beginning to rally, also was going
well at the end. BABA LOU forwardly placed inside, shuffled back slightly into the turn, traffic through upper stretch, finished up evenly. DREAMONMEBABY
off a step slow, raced back, saved some ground in the turn, improved position. WARRIOR'S MAP lacked speed, raced five out to six wide late turn, passed
tiring rivals. KOWALSKI broke on top, set pace two path early, gave way in the turn. FEATHERED INDIAN in the second flight while four wide into the turn,
tired in the drive. KICKIN' KIRBY lacked speed, fanned four wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. APPROVED mid pack, four to five wide turn, faded.
WE'RE STILL HERE remained always back.

WHOA NELLIE unhurried while off the inside, began a strong advance four out to five wide in the final turn, challenged into the lane, drew strongly clear
under steady handling. SPECIAL RELATIVITY settled off the pace inside, raced in the two path in the run up the backstretch, dropped back to the rail far
turn, improved to gain the second spot while not a threat to the winner. CAIRENN lacked speed, raced three wide into and through the final turn, staged a
mild rally to be along for the show. LADY SUEBEE broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, set a quick pace while maintaining a sizable advantage in the run up
the backstretch through some quick fractions, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. NOTAPRADAPRICE lacked early foot toward the
inside, improved slightly while never a serious threat. MAGICAL fell well back after the start, continued to late for five furlongs, improved three out to four
wide in the second turn, flattened out in the drive. REMEDY chased the leader through some quick fractions then gave way. SARA SEA forwardly placed for
a half, had little left. BLUE MOONRISE was also finished after four furlongs.

Footnotes
PIONEER SPIRIT with the pace form the start, shook clear into the far turn, shook off a rival turning for home to be clear again in upper stretch, enough left
to withstand the runner up in the final strides. BANKIT lacked early foot, encountered some traffic when advancing in the final turn, angled to the far outside
for the drive, finished fast to miss. MOCITO ROJO in the second flight while off the inside, moved closer second turn and briefly lodged a mild bid outside
the winner turning for home, failed to sustain that effort in the drive. M G WARRIOR with the early pace inside, took back before a quarter, saved ground
through the final turn, went evenly in the drive. BRAVAZO settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a significant response in the
drive. RATED R SUPERSTAR fell back to trail after the start, came four wide when attempting to rally, failed to stay on the final furlong.
COLONELSDARKTEMPER settled off the pace and the inside, continued to race well off the pace, made little impact in the drive. SEVIER vied early
outside the winner, began to give way in the far turn, continued to back up drive.

Footnotes
WHAT A FOX stalked the pace while racing four wide, challenged the leaders on the outside turning for home, drove clear. HEAVENS WHISPER back off
the early pace, advanced three wide by splitting horses turning for home, finished well to be clearly second best. LADY OF LUXURY within striking distance
early toward the inside, angled out three wide in some traffic exiting the turn, finished up best of the rest. GEORGIA'S REWARD lacked early foot, swung
four wide into the lane, improved position while remaining well out in the strip. EMBOLDENED off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, fanned five wide into
the lane, made a modest improvement through the stretch while not posing a serious threat. HOPTOWN HONEY steadied at the start, raced three wide in
the turn, went evenly through the stretch. DUTCH TREAT also steadied at the start, raced back, came five wide out of the bend, not dangerous in the drive.
STORM TRAFFIC fell back after the start, two path into the turn, passed tiring rivals while not a factor. RUBY TRUST vied up front while three wide, gave
way in the drive. CREATIVE INSTINCT with the pace for a half between rivals, also backed up when the real running began. BROADWAY COUNTY in mid
pack for a half, carried out to be six wide turning for home, also faded. HAWT MESS contested the pace while closest to the inside and stopped.
