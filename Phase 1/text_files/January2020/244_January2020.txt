Footnotes
ME AND JACK was void of any early speed, raced between rivals into the turn, angled out in late stretch, was gaining steadily and was up in time for the
win. SUITE ALONSO set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and was tagged at the wire. BLUE BOY WHO was allowed to settle
early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out five wide into early stretch, was closing late and just missed for the win. KEATON was unhurried early,
raced along the inside into the turn and offered no late rally. MAGIC CARPET RUN tracked the early pace, raced seven wide through the turn and was
empty late. SNOW IN THE NORTH was outrun early, raced along the inside into the turn and never fired. BANDI'S DOCTOR followed the early pace, went
six wide into the turn and tired.

Footnotes
TATANKA TRACKS pressed the pace of BISCUIT SNATCHER from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached that foe inside the furlong marker
and drew off with something left. BISCUIT SNATCHER broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
seven-sixteenths pole and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. QUANTICO JOE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out further approaching the stretch and finished with some late run. DISCLOSED lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn, reached a
contending position and finished evenly late. TARGARYCAT chased the leaders while racing four-wide for a half and weakened. MARTHAS BOY showed
brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. JUST PLUMB BOB showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach
contention. DARSHINI raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.
