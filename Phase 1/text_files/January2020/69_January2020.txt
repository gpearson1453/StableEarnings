Footnotes
SYRAH raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn four wide, rallied down the stretch and drove clear late. RIGHT ON BY unhurried in the
early part, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. ISLAND BLUE dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout,
saved ground and was outfinished by the top two. KINKY KIM raced within contention, eased back, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MISS BILLIE K
dueled for the early lead and weakened. ARGUMENT WON void of early speed, moved up, but was no threat. BECCA'S WHISPER raced evenly near the
back, had a wide trip and was never close. CHAMPAGNE MOMENT raced within striking distance and faded. QUICK RAE RAE lacked early speed, raced
wide around the first turn and showed little.

factor. FAR OUT TIME raced near the back, moved up late, but was no threat. CHARLIES TICKET raced within striking distance and weakened. KINLEE'S
SONG void of early speed and showed little. SPREAD THE FAITH raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the outside and faded.

Footnotes
TAPITOR unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside down the backstretch, rallied outside around the final turn and pulled away deep in the
stretch. FORESTDUNGONE went to the front, moved to the rail, drove clear, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but held off MAKE ME SMILE for
the place position. MAKE ME SMILE pressed the pace, saved ground and just missed the place. GREELEY'S DEALER raced near the back, saved ground
around the final turn, made a mild bid, but was no threat. SHOTSOFT challenged for the early lead and made a steady retreat. CONSUMERCONFIDENCE
had a tight start, racing in the back and was never close.

Footnotes
STANG IT stalked the leader in the early art, made a late bid and was going away at the end. PEACEFULLY sprinted to the front, drove clear, lacked a
finish and proved second best. RHETT'S RACER raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and followed the top two to the wire. LUCKY DARE
raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and was outfinished for third. OURS TO HOLD lacked early speed, raced outside around the
turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. HALF HEROINE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. UNTUTTABLE SPEED lacked early
speed and was never a factor. NANA'S MAGIC broke in, raced near the back and showed little. TENACIOUS FAITH raced near the middle of the pack,
faded, finished wide and was no threat.
