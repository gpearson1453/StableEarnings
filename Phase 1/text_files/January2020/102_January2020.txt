Footnotes
NO TIME TO PLAY chased the pace, shifted out midway down the backstretch and caused some bumping to her outside in the process, was hard ridden in
the two then three path on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, gained on the solo leader under the whip into the final furlong, took the advantage
at the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under strong handling. HERO OF GOLD was urged along off the pace, brushed with LAST TAP midway down the
backstretch then bumped with that foe when NO TIME TO PLAY came out shortly thereafter, went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a
drive and finished willingly to get the place late. STRONG PATRIOT quickly sped clear, drew off leaving the backstretch, opened up a very large advantage
while inside to the two path on the turn, was put to a drive just after turning into the stretch, came under the whip at the three-sixteenths, remained clear but
with the margin diminishing into the final furlong, was collared at the sixteenth-pole and weakened then lost the place late while clear for the show. KENAI
COOL was coaxed along on the outside then carried out midway down the backstretch, went four wide under urging on the turn, was carried out under a
drive in upper stretch and gained some to earn the last spot in the superfecta. MY MY MY raced towards the rear of the field, went two then three wide on
the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK lacked early speed, dropped well behind the rest of the
field, rounded the turn in the two path and showed little. LAST TAP was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, brushed with HERO OF GOLD
midway down the backstretch then bumped with that foe shortly thereafter, dropped back while inside on the turn and faltered then was vanned off and
reported to have bled.

Footnotes
RUSTON VOW broke a half-step slow, moved up to track the pace on the outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, vied four then three wide on the turn,
took the advantage in upper stretch, inched away outside the furlong marker and was fully extended to last under vigorous urging. MADELYN'S WILD MAX
lunged out at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, rallied into upper
stretch, chased the winner while still on his inside lead in the final furlong, gained on that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. BEAUTY BOY
brushed with a foe at the start, moved up on the inside of the leader to press the pace, chased along the rail on the turn, shifted to the two path into the
stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was outfinished while clear for the show. ONEHOLYLION bumped lightly with a rival at the start, raced just off
the pace, chased two to three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MAJOR RIDGE was ridden along at the rear of
the field, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted out near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. LASS SONG brushed with a
rival at the start, showed good speed and set the pace under some pressure from both sides, vied in the two path under some urging on the turn, lost the
lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. WARNED bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the
turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
HE'S THE SOUPERWON was bumped in the hind-end at the break but quickly recovered to move clear and dictate terms from the two path up the
backstretch, was under a snug hold through the turn, put to vigorous hand urging near the three-sixteenths and responded then was kept to task late.
TORNADO BOY was bumped into the inside rival at the start then exchanged another bump with the outside foe, at that juncture was put to urging, chased
along the rail through the turn, came out a path in upper stretch then back in, kept on but was second best. BIG TIME PLAYER, positioned between rivals
just off the early pace, continued two wide through the turn before coming out a path turning for home, was strongly urged in upper stretch but had no rally.
TEMPLE OF HEAVEN lacked early speed racing last but one, forced to go four then five wide on the turn, failed to rally. LITTLE WISE GUY chased from
between foes three wide early continuing in that path through the turn the turn then came up empty. MISTER broke outwardly, chased the leader shifting in
three deep just off that rival into the turn, drifted out a path late on that bend then a further path or two into upper stretch, came up empty. RONNIE'S
REASONING bumped the inside foe then exchanged a further bump at the start, switched out several paths wide trailing up the backstretch, entered the
turn in the four path gradually shifting in two paths late on that bend, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SINGITA DREAMS went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, advanced late on the backstretch, ranged up while dropping
from the two path to the rail early on the far turn, slipped through to make a bid inside of the pacesetter outside the quarter-pole then took a short lead,
battled with the runner-up under a drive in the stretch and proved best under strong urging. BLUNT FORCE went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace
on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch on even terms for the lead, battled outside of the
winner in the drive and was outfinished while well clear for the place. SWEET BLINDNESS went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was
urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while far clear for the
show. MISS SOONER GIRL saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch
and failed to respond. SAVED AT DAWN broke out at the start, went to the front, raced in the three path on the first turn, set the clear pace, vied in the three
path on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and stopped. ANGEL OF VERDUN moved in early, was well placed on the inside, raced under
urging midway down the backstretch, dropped back into the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE tracked under light rating early racing on or just off the rail early, began to come off the fence leaving the turn and received mild coaxing at
that juncture, came three deep past the quarter pole then out a further path for room, took aim and under steady handling got up late over WHISKEY
BRAVO, who stalked from outside two rivals up the backstretch and three to four wide on the turn, moved to take over just past the quarter pole under light
urging, more heavily ridden thereafter but was outfinished while clear of the rest. REIGNING WARRIOR settled at the rear, shifted in to save ground on the
rail into the turn, edged closer leaving that bend while starting to shift out, was strongly urged three wide in upper stretch and gained mildly late while getting
up for show honors. HANDFUL OF STRIPES set the pace in the clear early racing just removed from the rail, faced pressure late on the turn, was collared
at the top of the stretch and weakened late. PERFECT PIRATE broke well enough then settled in between foes pursuing the leader two to three wide
heading into the turn, was urged along early on that bend, began to weaken and came out a couple further paths in upper stretch and was empty for the
drive.

times with COME ON VENEZUELA, stalked outside for the rest of the backstretch, inched closer in the two to three path on the far turn, took the lead at the
quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip coming to the furlong marker, drifted out inside that marker, swapped back to his
inside lead while being switched to a right-handed whip approaching the sixteenth-pole, shifted inward in the process and proved best under steady urging.
SENOR FRIDAY bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind in the two path on the first turn, lagged at the rear, saved ground under urging on the
far turn, came out under a drive into upper stretch and finished with good energy for the place. PRYOR bumped with a rival into the first turn, went four wide
on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, came under the whip late on that bend and lacked the needed
response while able to get the show. SOUPER CATCH went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, saved ground under urging on
the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to rally. V TACH M. D. dropped in while going to the front, raced inside on the first turn, was
taken under a snug hold early on the backstretch, vied inside to the two path while put to urging on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and tired.
HALF TRICK broke out and was last away, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back while three then two wide on the far turn
and failed to respond. COME ON VENEZUELA bumped with a foe into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was bumped multiple times by OMEN OF
CHANGE near the five-eighths pole, dropped back under urging midway down the backstretch and retreated.

TAKEN BACK broke a step slowly and was in just a hair tight, settled at the rear while shifting in entering the turn in the two path, trailed to the head of the
lane before swinging five wide nearing the quarter pole, came out a further couple paths in upper stretch, kept on under urging to get up late. TWO
STEPPIN' STAR also broke just a step slowly and was slightly taken hold of, raced inside foes but just off the rail back several lengths from the leading
quartet into the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, was brushed in late stretch and fought on to garner the place. BET AGAIN stalked just off the leader
from outside in the early going, was bumped near the seven-sixteenths by an inside foes, forced four wide around the turn, inherited the lead in upper
stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging bumping a rival in the process. LUCK OF THE DRAW broke outwardly just a bit, settled in behind the leaders
shifting in to about the three path just off rivals into the turn, came out five wide in upper stretch, bid between foes late but received bumps from the inside
rival also brushing the outside foe. RELEASE THE BEAST raced well back between foes up the backstretch, appeared to be getting out a bit and checked
near the seven-sixteenths, dropped in to the rail to save ground early on the turn, came out several paths leaving that bend, had to veer and steady to avoid
a stricken horse near the furlong marker and ran on. PAPA'S BIG BOY came in a bit at the break, moved forward under mild urging to set the pace racing
off the rail, continued in the two path through the turn, was challenged in upper stretch having lugged in a bit past the quarter pole, weakened thereafter.
HARBOR KNIGHT raced outside foes toward the rear going three wide on the turn, lost ground into upper stretch then altered in to avoid a stricken foe. BIG
SHANTY was in tight and uncomfortable behind the early leader racing inside, coaxed his way outwardly leaving the backstretch and bumped the outside
foe lightly several times, tracked two to three wide on the turn then edged nearer to commence a bid leaving that bid, drew even in upper stretch, then
appeared to go wrong about the three-sixteenths, was thereupon pulled up just past the furlong marker and vanned off. Following the race, the stewards
launched an inquiry and upon review, BET AGAIN was disqualified from third and placed fourth behind LUCK OF THE DRAW for causing interference in
late stretch.

Footnotes
LUSITANO went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, responded well when asked under threat from ITALIAN CHARM at the
quarter-pole, disposed of that foe in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. SKYCRAFT went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the
pace, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and safely secured the place while no match for the winner.
ITALIAN CHARM went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was asked in the three path early on the far
turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and weakened then just held the show. RUN TAPPY
angled in early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved on the inside, angled four wide at the five-sixteenths, floated six wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response then just missed the show. SON OF A SAINT was restless in the gate, established a good position early, was rated just off the
pace on the inside, drafted behind horses early on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths and came up empty. MURRY SPUR moved his head at
the start and was off about two lengths slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside under some restraint, dropped back while four to five wide on
the far turn, moved to three wide nearing the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
NO PAROLE was quickly clear, dictated terms on or just off the rail, began to edge away leaving the turn, received vigorous hand urging in upper stretch
and responded, drew away before being geared down late. PALVERA raced outside a foe just off the aforementioned in the early going, exchanged light
contact leaving the backstretch, traveled three to four wide still outside a rival on the turn, kept on in the stretch to hold the place. HEZA PRIORITY broke a
half-step slowly, raced toward the rear from off the inside, appeared to get out just a bit entering the turn going in the three to four path on that bend, came
out about six wide for the drive and got up for show honors late. ATTA BOUY was bumped at the break, settled at the rear racing near but just off the fence
into and through the turn, gradually came out about five then six wide in upper stretch, ran on to improve position. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG raced
mid-division up the backstretch racing off the inside, went in the three path on the turn, encouraged along leaving that bend and drifted out gradually through
the lane under steady left-handed urging, was outfinished for the minor award. PICKENS tracked the winner from off the inside, lightly brushed the outside
foe leaving the backstretch, was empty in the stretch. REACH THE CIRCLE bumped the outside foe at the start, raced off the fence in about the two then
three path on the turn and failed to rally. ONE PROUD BOY steadily dropped back racing wide up the backstretch going five deep into the turn, was asked
for run near the three-eighths but had no response. AW ITE chased off the leaders early from inside mostly in about the two path, faded.

Footnotes
MONTE MAN stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up to make a bid in the four path on the turn, took over while set down in upper stretch and prevailed
under strong urging. INSPECTOR EDDIE broke very fast, set the pace through reasonable fractions, lost the lead while skimming the rail on the turn, fought
on gamely in the stretch but missed while just able to get the place. RECKLESS RANSOM moved up under urging then tracked the pace, made a bid at the
seven-sixteenths, took a short lead in the three path on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and just
missed the place while clear for the show. DOUBLE BARREL MAN was urged along on the outside, went five wide early on the turn then dropped to the
three path, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MY FRIEND FLAVIN had his head turned at the start and was last away then
taken up ever so slightly, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths and came up empty. IMPRESSIVE
STUDENT settled off the pace, started the turn in the three path, angled four then five wide later on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
GEM OF CARLOS chased the pace, gained in the four path on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, drew clear into the final furlong and maintained a safe
advantage under steady urging. MAGICAL CANDY lunged out at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along while well
behind, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch, angled out while gaining at the three-sixteenths and finished well but was too late while
clear for the place. TIME TO ROME brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while well clear for the show. SOUTHERN LIGHT brushed with foes
at the start and was off a step slow, settled under some urging, raced in the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. KING'S PRAYER broke out and
brushed with a foe, sped clear and set the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch and tired. CAPONE'S LOFT settled on the
outside, moved in nearing the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE was fractious behind the gate while
reluctant to load, broke slow then veered in and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under urging, chased inside on the turn and retreated. FIRST
METAL COUNT chased the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, fell further back while five wide on the turn, drifted in after turning
into the stretch and faltered.
