Footnotes
PEGGY B FAST was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with DESERT GHOST while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong
to run and drew off as a handy winner with little need of urging. DESERT GHOST dueled for the early advantage from the inside with the winner, was no
match for that rival through the final furlong but clearly second best. SO PRO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. PASSION RIDE hopped at the start, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention. TSURUOKA lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. I'M NOT A PAINT chased the leaders from the inside for
three furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY KATIE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and held for the win. SINGING ALLI was void of any early speed,
circled seven wide into the turn, was gaining late and just missed for the win. MERLIN'S JEWEL chased the early pace, raced between rivals into the turn
and weakened. FIGURE was unhurried early, raced along the inside and offered no late rally. LADY LEX tracked the early pace, went four wide into the turn
and was empty late. SEVENTH TEE was outrun early, loomed six wide into the turn and flattened out. MISS MCFAD raced in mid pack early, raced
between rivals into the turn and faded.

Footnotes
JACK'S PARTY GIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached SHAULA with a furlong to run and edged away
from that rival through the closing yards. SHAULA was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eights marker,
responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch and gave way grudgingly in the drive. ENDLESS THYME was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. CUTE KNOWS CUTE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and finished with some late run. TAX MONEY showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished evenly
late. RED SPRING lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. ROBTHEQUEEN was bumped at the break, lacked early sped,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PEARL OF LAREDO showed no early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention. ICE POP was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and weakened.
DRINK MO HENNESSY was bumped at the start, chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.
