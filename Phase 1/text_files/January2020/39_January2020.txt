Footnotes
BLUEGRASS SKY saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch, came out past the eighth pole and rallied under urging to get up in the
final stride. ELGOFRANCO had speed a bit off the rail then stalked between foes then outside a rival, bid alongside the pacesetter into the stretch, took a
short lead, inched away in deep stretch but was caught on the line. ON MARS broke a bit slowly, sped between horses then inched away and set the pace
inside, fought back in the stretch and to deep stretch and held third. LETS GET WILD between horses early, stalked three deep then outside a rival on the
turn and three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ARISTEIA a bit slow to begin, pulled between horses then chased off the rail, angled in on
the turn, came out into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. LUCKY LONG LEGS broke a bit slowly, settled outside then off the rail,
came three wide into the stretch and bested the others. OUI SAY NO stalked five wide on the backstretch, went three deep on the turn, angled in between
foes nearing the stretch and weakened. SHENANDOAH STAR broke a bit slowly, pulled between horses and steadied into the turn, angled in leaving the
turn, steadied again in tight into the stretch and had little left for the drive. CHROMES LIL SIS stalked four wide between foes, angled in and dropped back
on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR stalked between horses then a bit off the rail, angled to the fence on the turn and rallied under urging along the inside to the front a
sixteenth out to win clear. WILD CAT CANYON sped to the early lead, set the pace just off the rail, drifted out despite right handed urging in the stretch and
was second best. MY JOURNEY stalked between horses, came three wide into the stretch and bested the others. J C'S HENRIETTA unhurried off the rail
early, angled in leaving the backstretch, came out into the stretch and improved position. SILVER FURY stalked between horses then four wide into the
turn, continued three deep on the bend and four wide into the stretch and weakened. STRONG RULER saved ground chasing the pace, fell back on the turn
and also weakened. ROYAL RANGER stalked inside then a bit off the rail, was between horses leaving the turn and had little left for the drive. CREEDS
REVENGE close up stalking the pace four wide early, dropped back and angled in leaving the backstretch, found the inside in the stretch and gave way.

midstretch and finished well for the place. SEA OF LIBERTY tugged between horses then stalked inside, was shuffled back nearing midway on the second
turn, came out in upper stretch and again in midstretch and came on willingly between foes in deep stretch to edged rivals for third. JETOVATOR tugged
three deep then bid three wide on the backstretch and into the second turn, battled outside the pacesetter leaving that turn and into the stretch, put a head
in front between horses in midstretch and was edged for the show. BUD KNIGHT angled in and chased outside a rival, came out in upper stretch and was
outfinished for a minor share. FRAVEL stalked three deep, went four wide into and out of the second turn and could not quite summon the needed late kick.

back in midstretch and until deep stretch and weakened late. ABUSIVE GARY pulled between horses early, pressed the pace outside a rival then stalked a
bit off the rail, steadied between horses early on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DESERT STONE (IRE) broke in and a bit slowly, saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and again in midstretch and rallied under some
left handed urging and a strong hand ride to get up nearing the wire. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE stalked between horses, came out three deep into the stretch,
rallied to a short lead between horses in deep stretch and continued willingly but could not hold off the winner. MAJESTIC EAGLE between horses early,
stalked a bit off the rail, bid alongside the pacesetter on the second turn and into the stretch, took a short lead outside that one in the drive, fought back in
deep stretch and held third. CHOSEN VESSEL saved ground stalking the pace, came out for room in midstretch and continued willingly to be edged for the
show. NORTH COUNTY GUY broke a step slowly and was a bit crowded, chased outside a rival, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
late kick three deep on the line. OVERDUE took the early lead and angled in, set the pace inside, fought back on the second turn and in the stretch and
weakened late. ACKER stalked three deep, came four wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

turn, drifted out a bit from the whip past midstretch and held third outside a foe on the line. SIGALERT stalked between horses, angled to the inside in the
stretch and finished with interest along the fence. ITALIANO close up stalking the pace three deep on the backstretch and turn, came out four wide into the
stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick. ORDER AND LAW chased off the rail then outside on the turn, came three wide into the stretch
and also could not quite offer the necessary late response. HEARTFULLOFSTARS a step slow to begin, chased inside then a bit off the rail leaving the turn,

Footnotes
AN EDDIE SURPRISE stalked between horses then outside a rival leaving the turn, came three deep into the stretch, bid three wide under urging a
sixteenth out and got up nearing the wire. ANONYMOUSLY had speed between horses then dueled outside a rival, re-bid between horses a sixteenth out,
took a slim advantage in deep stretch and continued gamely to the wire. QUEEN OF THE TRACK had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away in
midstretch, fought back along the rail in deep stretch and also continued willingly. HELLO BUBBLES broke a bit slowly, went u p inside to stalk the pace,
continued along the rail on the turn and in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. ROCKIN READY stalked outside a rival then between horses on the
backstretch and a bit off the rail on the turn, found the fence in the stretch, came out in deep stretch and could not offer the necessary late response.
MAGICAL GRAY three deep early, stalked off the rail then three wide on the turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SWING
THOUGHTS settled a bit off the rail then inside on the turn, came out some into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SILKEN SPY stalked between
horses then four wide into the turn, angled in outside a rival on the bend, came three deep into the stretch and weakened. MARIAH GIRL (ARG) chased
outside then four wide leaving the backstretch and three deep on the turn, angled in outside a rival leaving the turn and had little left for the drive.
