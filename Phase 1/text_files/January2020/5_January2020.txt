Footnotes
WINYAH BAY close up outside to turn, went around field into the stretch to the lead and cleared off under steady urging in the final furlong. TEMPLEMENT
unhurried early, commenced wide rally into the turn but proved no match for winner. A WICKED WILDCAT inside run to quarter pole, altered out and back in
upper stretch and settled for the show spot. REMISSION had a tardy start, well off rail into the stretch while only improving late. DEVILS DAUGHTER sharp
early speed, led past the half but faltered in the drive. DEAR THEODOSIA hustled along with brief early foot to the turn and gave way thereafter. KINGS BIG
ROAD reluctant to load and was through early. WEST COAST TEMPLE broke in a bit of a tangle from the gate, roused sharply with no response. SIMPSON
COUNTY trailed to the half while only passing tired ones in the stretch. YELLOW BIRD inside speed to mid stretch but faded in the final furlong. PRINCESS
MARYKATE was antsy loading and never a factor. CUMBERLAND PASS was also reluctant to load while quick from the gate but through at the half.

ROAD TO CAIRO perfectly placed to far turn, swept three wide past the leaders and drew off late. GRAY DONOVAN good early speed from inside past
quarter pole,while no match for the winner. BAND OF THIEVES under restraint to quarter pole, asked into the stretch with nothing left coming up empty in
the drive. FRIEND ZONE inside trip from the turn, moved up in final furlong, no threat. GUNNY ROO never a real treat. SENOR WILBUR never close while
wide into the stretch. CRUZ DIEZ unhurried early, middle move to far turn, came up empty. EL GATO FELIX B slow start, never recovered. VALID STORM
with pace to the half, weakened from the quarter pole.

LOVING MOMENT chased the pace early, fanned into the five path entering the lane, made a bid down the lane, drove past the leader inside the eighth
pole and cleared the field in the final stages. FRILLS broke out at the start and took out multiple rivals, tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the
lane, inched ahead in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the late stages. QUALITY TOO SPARE set the pace early, shifted into the three path in
the turn and faltered in the stretch run. JUST A LOOK was back early on, raced along the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. LYNDA D
was on the inside into the lane and improved position. SURPLUS GOLD chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but
faded late in the drive. CARLEXA was taken out at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and empty in the stretch run. LADY
