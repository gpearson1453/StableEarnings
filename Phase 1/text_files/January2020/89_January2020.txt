Footnotes
LADY NOY popped out of the gate in front, chased MISS LORETTA up the backstretch, dropped back around the turn in the two-path, moved to the rail
getting a second wind through midstretch and rallied to edge away in the last 50 yards. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB was outsprinted three then four wide to the
stretch, and finished well on the far outside to get up for second. BALLIE'S DREAM raced three wide pressing the early pace, bid outside MISS LORETTA
into the final furlong but was outkicked. BELLA GIANNA stayed in range two then three wide early, and was outfinished between horses. KATNISS KAN
was outrun inside early, moved out in the drive and gained mildly. MISS LORETTA set the early pace inside, drew clear in the two-path through upper
stretch, shortened stride through the last sixteenth of a mile and was overrun from both sides. WHER'D DA LOVE GO was well placed inside tracking the
leaders to the stretch, moved to the two-path and lacked a solid bid through some late traffic. SABINA PARK failed to factor two to three wide. COOKIE
COVE raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. HOLLY HILL was outrun inside. MAMA JO was slow into stride, three wide around
the turn at the back, and made no late headway outside. I'M A ROCKSTAR trailed inside.

Footnotes
FREEZER BURN tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch then prompted and advanced three wide to challenge DON'TEATTHEAPPLE for the
lead at five sixteenths pole, vied into stretch run then shook clear approaching the furlong marker, stayed under steady pressure and held on over late
gaining SHAZZY B. SHAZZY B raced in range between foes going by the half mile marker, kept along in steady pursuit around the turn, moved into upper
stretch four wide, steadily advanced closer under left handed pressure, was getting to FREEZER BURN in final strides but ran out of time. MS.
MALEVOLENCE was off to a good start but lacked the early foot to move on for the lead, hustled along into the turn, roused between foes past the quarter
pole, was set down driving six wide in stretch run, stayed on with response and gained share. DON'T EATTHE APPLE was away in good order and vied for
the lead racing outside of TRULY AMBITIOUS, continued to battle leaving the backstretch then began to edge by aforementioned foe mid-way through the
turn while taking on the challenge from FREEZER BURN, vied for the lead into stretch then failed to keep pace nearing the furlong marker and gave way.
KASHAN raced in pursuit positioned widest through the backstretch, continued a bid along the outside around the turn, raced widest in the lane and needed
more for late impact. GITANA lacked early kick and raced off the pace, floated out five wide entering top stretch then switched in a few paths and passed
tiring foes. ROMANTIC TALE chased in range along the inside then hustled up two wide around the turn, kept under a ride upper stretch but had no kick left
in reserve and weakened. LIZA raced off the pace and two wide leaving the backstretch, failed to respond under pressure around the turn and offered no
late rally. PAINT YOUR DREAM came away slowly at the start and trailed the field. TRULY AMBITIOUS vied for the early lead with DON'T EATTHE
APPLE, continued to battle into the turn then failed to match at five sixteenths pole and retreated.

CASTAGNO tracked the early pace inside, moved to the two-path late on the far turn, wrested command outside BAHAMIAN PARK through the furlong
grounds and was hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile. BAHAMIAN PARK established an easy pace inside, could not handle CASTAGNO through
midstretch and remained clear of the others. WARRANT OFFICER entered the backstretch three wide, remained out in the course coming under a ride by
midway on the far turn, but could not gain on the leaders. BEINFUN prompted the pace two to three wide on the turns, and faded in the stretch. ALL D'
HYPE was three wide early, was put to as drive around the far turn in the two-path, and had nothing. EXATLON was finished early inside.

Footnotes
MAKE A STAND was forwardly position around the first turn then advanced to challenge LE COSTE for the lead entering the backstretch, continued to
match strides into the far turn, began to edge away from rival while WINTER AT BASTOGONE loomed up to challenge near the three eighths pole,
prompted and turned back bid, roused for more turning for home, stayed sharp in response and kept clear. CLEVELAND SIMPSON tugged in opening
stages then settled and raced in tracking mode off the top pair, edged up closer along the inside leaving the backstretch and clipped heels with LE COSTE
nearing the three eighths pole, got shuffled back then moved back up into tight quarters near the quarter pole, ran out of racing room late turn and took the
inside spot, switched to the outside path of MAKE A STAND upper stretch, chased on but could not get to the winner. BLESSED JOURNEY settled along
the inside never too far off the early pace, angled out and headed in pursuit entering the far turn, moved up closer and race five wide turning for home,
continued a steady outside bid in the lane and raced along for show. RATIFY rated not too far off the early pace, prompted four wide entering the far turn
and loomed up closer, stayed on with interest upper stretch then gave way near the furlong grounds. EXPRESS BOY was unhurried and raced in the back,
shifted out at head of the lane then came in a couple paths, shifted out wider under pressure and lacked a needed rally. WINTER AT BASTOGNE raced in
range and tracked the pace down the backstretch, edged up three wide to race in aim for the lead near the three eighths pole, continued bid in close range
into upper stretch then faded in final furlong. LE COSTE led the way around the first turn then challenged and vied for the lead with MAKE A STAND down
the backstretch, could not move on with rival mid-way around the final turn, lost position then checked while lacking racing room leaving the turn and
dropped back.

TWO CENTS WORTH broke to the lead, rated along inside gradually widening the advantage, continued to draw away under pressure through the stretch,
and was hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile. FLAT OUT COOL brushed with FLASH PETITION at the start, chased inside early, moved to the two-path
passing the five-sixteenths, could not menace the winner and was clear of the rest. BABY SABRINA dropped back around the turn two then three wide, and
ran on to edge MAGNITUDE TEN for the show spot. MAGNITUDE TEN was shut off and checked behind AWESOME EVIL and AALIYAH MARIE at the
start, saved ground throughout and improved past tired horses. MYSTIC COMIN HOME lunged inward at the start, gave chase three wide for a half-mile or
so, and tired. AWESOME EVIL failed to threaten three then four wide on the turn. FLASH PETITION broke out brushing FLAT OUT COOL and was away
slowly, and lacked a response inside. AALIYAH MARIE was finished early in the two-path.

Footnotes
TIGER BLOOD was forwardly placed out of the gate and vied for the lead racing outside of NEVER HAVE I EVER around the turn, shook free under
pressure near the furlong marker, kept on gamely and finished clear. THE GIPPER hustled along in steady pursuit of the top trio through early stages, kept
on under pressure racing five wide with a furlong left to run, dug in under steady pressure and edged by late to take place. TENACITY ZIP was not too far
off the early pace and saved ground along the rail in the turn, was under a rode two wide entering top stretch, gained position under pressure and just lasted
for show. GO GONE GONE raced off the top two leaders and chased three wide around the turn, stayed on with response in stretch run then evened out in
final stages and got nipped for show. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) quickly cleared out of the gate and angled to the inside, vied for the lead racing inside of
TIGER BLOOD around the turn, fought back upper stretch then had no kick in reserve and gave way. JUST THE FACTS raced off the early speed, hustled
up along the outside entering top stretch, shifted in near the furlong marker and lacked a needed rally. COROT lacked early foot and raced in the back,
moved into stretch run two wide and failed to respond. Due to malfunction all times were omitted.

Footnotes
MY SEBASTIANA tossed her head and hesitated at the break to spot the field several lengths, moved off the inside on the far turn beginning to advance,
split horses rallying through the furlong grounds and drove clear late. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL lagged well back to the stretch three wide, found her best stride
late and was up between horses for the place. GOLDEN SPLENDOR broke out at the start, set the pace inside to the stretch, and weakened through the
final furlong. PEACE CONTROL raced four wide in range to the stretch, and needed more. BLUE BLUE ICE raced widest throughout and was never a
factor. STORMY BOSS had aim at the leaders three wide on the turn, gained the advantage outside GOLDEN SPLENDOR coming to the eighth-pole, but
wilted through the late stages. SPEED TOO TUME saved ground and failed to menace. SOUTHERN TODDY pressed the pace outside for a half-mile, and
tired in the stretch. OLIVIA'S DREAM was slow to get going and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BLUE MAGIC got bumped at the start then was allowed to settle in opening stages, dropped to the inside late backstretch then picked up the pace around
the turn, was put to a drive upper stretch, kicked in gamely, rallied along the outside and got up in time. DISTINCTLY BLUE was forwardly placed racing
behind the leader in opening stages, hustled along and chased after rival around the turn, was ridden up and challenge DEALER'S GIRL for the lead in the
final furlong, wrested the advantage under pressure then got caught approaching the wire. DEALER'S GIRL veered in and bumped into foe at the start then
cleared on top and angled to the inside, held firm still unleashed moving through the turn, was put to a drive when oncoming DISTINCTLY BLUE loomed up
to challenge past the furlong marker, got collared for the lead then gave way but stayed on for share. CAPE TRIOS hustled along in steady pursuit and
chased the top two leaders around the turn, stayed on four to five wide under pressure upper stretch then lacked kick and raced evenly in late stages.
BELLS IRISH FANCY raced off the clear top trio moving into the turn, kept under steady pressure around the turn, raced four wide into the lane and failed to
gain a threatening position. SOME SAY SO raced near then in the back, hustled along five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GOLCONDA (FR)
got bumped then bumped into the winner at the start, raced in then near the back, saved ground into stretch turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
EKHTIBAAR was sent for the lead inside entering the main track, rated along clear through the middle stages, dug in when confronted by KID BOURBON
turning for home, and withstood a long drive for a hard-fought decision. KID BOURBON advanced four wide late on the turn, ranged up to challenge outside
EKHTIBAAR at the top of the stretch, but could not get by while much best of the rest. AND SEEK raced three wide around the turn, could not get near the
top two finishers but was up for the show outside BABY I'M PERFECT. The latter stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and faded. BLEWITT bobbled
slightly coming away from the gate, pressed the pace outside the eventual winner, and came up empty after six furlongs. FULLNESS OF TIME settled in the
middle of the field two to three wide early, and lacked the needed response. GRIT AND GLORY was outrun throughout. MAC JAGGER was always outrun.
BYBEE trailed every step of the way.

Footnotes
LADY GRACE got brushed at the start then angled to the inside, raced in range and saved ground around the turn, switched out a path and headed in
pursuit top stretch, split foes gamely under right handed pressure and held firm. SWEET YARE N DIRA switched in a few paths from the outside position in
opening stages, raced in contention and chased after the top two leaders around the turn, set down five wide for the drive, raced in aim with a furlong left to
run, failed to kick on with the winner but stayed on with good response. MISS AURAMET was forwardly placed and forced the pace in opening stages, vied
for the lead racing in the path outside of GLORY ROLL around the turn, kept on to race in aim three deep near mid-stretch then evened out in the final
sixteenth. GLORY ROLL sped to the lead and set a pressured pace in opening stages then continued to hold the edge over MISS AURAMET around the
turn, fought back upper stretch then got collared for the lead by the winner and gave way. VILARO raced under slight restraint entering the turn then took
the rail position and saved ground around the turn, angled out and headed in pursuit at head of the lane but lacked the needed response for late impact.
FOUR K'S shifted to the outside in opening stages, raced off the pace then hustled along racing along the outside entering stretch run and lacked a needed
rally. DANCE TILL DAWN raced off the early speed, saved ground along the inside around the turn, shifted out wider for the drive and failed to kick on.
TRUE HEIRESS was slow into stride at the start, lacked speed, raced in the back and failed to move on under pressure in the lane. RICHIE'S SISTER
broke In and brushed with foes at the start, chased near midpack around the turn then came up empty in the lane.
