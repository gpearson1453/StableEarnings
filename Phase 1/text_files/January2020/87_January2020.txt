Footnotes
THINKING OF HER was away alertly, dropped off the pace under urging, went three then two wide on the turn, came through inside of a tiring foe outside
the quarter-pole, was driven into the stretch, angled out while gaining at the three-sixteenths, rallied while still on her inside lead, closed well to take the lead
at the furlong marker, kicked clear under the whip outside the sixteenth-pole then switched to the proper lead into the final sixteenth and proved much the
best while eased up significantly in the end. PRAY FOR LISA was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, showed speed and set the pace, extended the
advantage while inside on the turn, was headed while still on her inside lead into the final furlong and weakened while able to hold the place. RED RIVER
CHASE settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in under a drive around the
three-sixteenths, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and clearly earned the show. TOSHITA FOREVER broke a bit slow then dropped back, angled in at
the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MANE PRIORITY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back while coming out a bit more into the stretch and faded. QUEEN E bumped soundly with a rival at the start
while also bumping with another foe, established a good position just off the pace, came up empty along the rail on the turn and retreated. ALWAYS
CUSTOM LOVE settled well off the pace, saved ground on the turn and showed little. ALL FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE AND THE FINAL TIME
WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
SOARING NOW was in tight after the start then dropped to the rail, settled just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked
while given a sizable opening at the top of the stretch, made an inside bid at the three-sixteenths, fought with COLOR ME PRETTY into the final furlong,
disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth and just held off the runner-up under strong urging. MISS BROOKSIDE went around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, was roused while five wide on the far turn, floated seven wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed well to just miss while
clear for the place. COLOR ME PRETTY went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under some urging while two to three wide on
the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, led into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
was out-kicked while just able to get the show. FORGOTTEN was taken back early, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, raced inside for
most of the far turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch then shifted out while put to a drive before the
three-sixteenths, held a good striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick and just missed the show. GYMNASTIC rounded the first turn
in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, stalked in the three path on the far turn, made a bid into the stretch, led briefly outside the
three-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. LA FLOR set the pace in the two path, was asked inside the
five-sixteenths, lost the lead into upper stretch, was crowded between horses while dropping around the three-sixteenths and gave way. FELL FROM
GRACE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 14 Feet)

Footnotes
MARK OF THE Z broke alertly then was hustled, set the pace, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper
stretch and drew off under strong urging. WARRIORS GEM bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn,
made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place.
FUTURE ABUNDANCE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the
stretch then moved out under the whip approaching the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. ZYPTO was ridden along at
the rear on the outside, angled in outside the half-mile pole, moved from the rail to the three path early on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and
failed to threaten. PULL MY CHAIN moved up while urged along then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, dropped back while five wide into the
stretch and tired. MOST MISCHIEF moved up while urged along then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused for more outside the
quarter-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
MISHKO bumped with a rival after the start, was rated off the pace in the two path, drafted behind horses on the far turn, was given his cue outside the
quarter-pole, rallied four wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, dueled gamely with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. MOM SAID YES was caught six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went three wide early on the far turn then shifted
five wide around the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch, rallied to make an outside bid inside the three-sixteenths, dueled with the winner in
the final furlong, had the rider lose his whip inside the sixteenth-pole and just missed while clear for the place. ATLAS MOON bumped with a foe at the start,
dropped back while in tight between horses early, went four to five wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path,
came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. HOMEBRED bumped with a rival after the start, went four then
three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the far turn, took the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, drifted inward in upper stretch then was headed, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. DATA LOAD bumped with a rival at the
start, went five then four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, dropped back under a
drive into the final furlong and came up empty. COUNTRY BERTI lost his footing behind at the start and was last to commence, traveled around the first turn
in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. CONFECTIONIST bumped with a rival just after
the start, lugged out three wide into the first turn then dropped to the inside, set the pace through tepid fractions, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost
the lead outside the quarter-pole and stopped. (Rail at 22 Feet)

Footnotes
HOMEVIEW moved clear willingly shortly after the start following breaking a half-step slow, shifted in leaving the backstretch dictating terms near but just off
the rail through the turn on a clear margin, asked in upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. SPARKYS SURPRISE settled last but one in about
the two to three path into the turn, shifted six then seven deep in upper stretch, was strongly ridden and rallied to get up for second over CEE R BEE, who
exchanged repeated bumps with the inside rival at the break, chased between foes briefly then outside a rival into the turn going three then four wide on that
bend, could make no headway on the winner late and lost the place. RAIN DROP KID was bumped around between foes at the start, tucked in behind the
leaders shifting to about the two path heading into the turn, gradually began to come out past the five-sixteenths coming four deep into upper stretch, ran on
mildly but lacked the needed late kick. PLEASANT STREET settled at the rear, began to advance in the two path on the turn and passed tired rivals in the
stretch. RED WHITE AND LOUD broke outwardly bumping a rival several times at the start, switched outside the pacesetter as that one shifted in up the
backstretch, entered the turn in the three path, shifted in and was asked for more near the five-sixteenths but offered little and faded in the lane. WILDCAT
SAINT chased outside early, dropped back in the three to four path on the turn, was getting out into upper stretch and eased late but walked off.

MISS MERCKEN went four wide on the first turn, settled comfortably on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, swept to the lead at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held under strong urging. STROLLIN THE BAYOU saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the pace,
came under urging in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly while
well clear for the place. TRYON SUMMER bumped with a rival at the start then moved up to take the lead, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the
pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and weakened then drifted out around the sixteenth-pole while clear for
the show. LITTLE CODE went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced in the
two path while ridden along on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. GLANCE bumped with a foe at the start, went three wide
on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, battled between horses entering the stretch, dropped back past the
three-sixteenths and stopped. FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE AND FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

widened the margin into upper stretch and was asked nearing mid-stretch, appeared to shy inwardly from the whip in very late stretch and was taken in
hand thereafter. NO QUARTER was bumped outwardly at the break, pressed briefly inside the aforementioned then chased from inside before switching out
three deep nearing the three-eighths pole, steadily urged past the five-sixteenths, could make no headway on the winner but held second from IN A BIND,
who stalked from outside early, edged closer four deep midway on the turn, kept on in the lane but missed the place. ALTERANA bumped the outside rival
at the start, chased in behind mid-division but just off the fence, continued inside a rival but still in the two path through the turn, ran evenly in the stretch.
FLAT OUT CAT broke just a half-step slowly, advanced mildly four wide under coaxing into the turn shifting in a path early on that bend, flattened out in the
stretch. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN was a half step slow out of the gate, trailed early going in about the two path through the turn, failed to rally but passed a
foe in the stretch. TRUTH TELLER was a bit fractious in the paddock, dropped back from between foes leaving the backstretch entering the turn in the three
path, came out a further path late on that bend, was not urged in the final furlong and faded.

Footnotes
SPRING VALUE angled in while settling off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, steadied when IT'S A SWEET ONE dropped back in front of her
some outside the five-sixteenths, was roused into upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the runner-up to the
wire and gamely prevailed under strong urging. FAT CLEMENZA broke a half-step slow then bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went two to
three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted in while batting
determinedly with the winner late and just missed while clear for the place. CHRISTOPHER CAT chased the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, took
the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the show. IT'S A SWEET ONE chased the pace near
the inside, dropped back a bit around the five-sixteenths then moved to a clear two path, swung four wide into the stretch and weakened. BLUE CHOICE
was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch under the whip and came up
empty. RAHFEES MAN broke a half-step slow, was ridden along on the outside at the rear, went five wide on the turn, was driven eight wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. BETTERCALLJOHN was hustled from the start, crossed over while going to the front, raced in the two path on the turn, lost the
advantage into upper stretch and faded. IT'S MIKE'S TURN broke a half-step slow then bumped with a foe, was urged along near the back, went four wide
on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. T' CADEAU was ridden along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn,
dropped back while seven wide into the stretch and faltered.
