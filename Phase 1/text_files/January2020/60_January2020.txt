Footnotes
ROSKILDE broke in front, set all the pace and just lasted under right handed urging. SELLING OUT never far back, closed fast in the five path through the
stretch and just missed getting up in time. D'MONEY HONEY allowed to settle, was steadily gaining ground late two wide. GOT GRIT trailed into the stretch
then closed a gap late in the six path. WIZARD WILLIE chased the winner into the stretch then faded three wide in the final furlong. GO TO WIN saved
ground and weakened late. QUIETLY CUBA had speed three wide into the turn then came up empty. ROBERT'S PRINCE was no factor.

Footnotes
I RECALL allowed to settle, closed with a burst of speed in the seven path through the stretch, made the lead near the sixteenths pole and drew off rapidly
to win in handy. GRINS N' WINS was squeezed at the start, chased the pace from the four path into the stretch, dropped to the rail, made the lead late then
was no match for the winner. QUEEN HIGH found her best stride late in the four path. MIZZEN SPOILS chased the pace into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. CENTSOFSTYLE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then weakened. JUDGE REESE was no
threat. SHE'S CRAFTY was no factor. KIMTASTIC failed to menace. CHARDON had brief speed. ENDURING LOVE was never close. OPALESCENT
flashed brief foot.

Footnotes
TIGER TRAIL stalked the pace into the turn, rallied four wide to make the lead in upper stretch, shook clear and prevailed under strong handling. MASTER
LEGIONAIRE allowed to settle, entering the stretch near the seven path, altered course sharply to the three path, steadied momentarily past the furlong
marker, dug in determinedly four wide and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. JOES A ROCKIN dueled for the lead along the inside until
mid stretch then was outfinished. DARK MAZE offered a mild bid five wide on the turn then leveled off. FLYINUNDERTHERADAR matched strides for the
lead two wide until mid stretch then weakened. READY TO ROCKET with the second flight inside, failed to respond. NOTHINLASTSFOREVER offered a
mild bid two wide on the turn then came up empty. LUNAR CAP was outrun. HIGH DOLLAR was no factor.

Footnotes
SPEZIA had speed from the start, chasing the pace two wide into the stretch, rallied to make the lead past the furlong marker and edged clear late under
mild urging. BEAUTIFUL GAME well placed, had a mild late rally in the five path and got up for second. REBEL ROAD never far back, offered a mild bid in
the four path into the stretch then was outfinished. MAKES GOOD SENSE broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished.
CHARLESTON PIER vied for the lead along the rail into the stretch and faded late. CREATIVE THUNDER failed to menace. ROTTAKEN was no threat.
DONATION was outrun. CRACKIN JON had brief speed. ORE PASS was no factor.
