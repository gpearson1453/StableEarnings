Footnotes
FIVE OF HEARTS sped to the front at once, widened the advantage along the inside, and was driving to the sixteenth-pole before coasting in. STARSHIP
BUBBA raced three wide around the turn, and offered a mild response on the far outside to get second. FRANK FIRST bumped with DIALED IN GOLD at
the start, had the two-path in the second flight on the turn, and was outfinished for the place. WEEKEND DREAMER broke a step slow, hustled up and
steadied inside FIVE OF HEARTS after a sixteenth of a mile or so, moved out three wide midway on the turn, and faded steadily. ALL POWER broke out
bumping DIALED IN GOLD at the start, chased the winner to the end of the turn, and tired. JUAN BOLY raced four wide around the turn, and was no factor.
DIALED IN GOLD steadied back after being bounced around between ALL POWER and FRANK FIRST at the start, and was through early inside. FORT
OF AVON trailed throughout and was not pressed through the stretch.

Footnotes
CROSS COURT matched strides out of the gate then conceded position to NICHOLAS ROSE, raced in close contention and tracked rival through early
stages then prompted late backstretch, advanced to briefly race on equal terms for the lead with aforementioned foe then cleared on top midway through the
turn, widened the advantage while hand ridden entering top stretch then shook the reins and shown the whip, stayed sharp in response and kept to task.
UNCLE SKEETS was off to a good start and positioned in close range, hustled up racing in three path moving through the turn, stayed on five wide with
response in the lane and secured second placing. JEALOUS BOYFRIEND was forwardly positioned out of the gate then dropped back off the top trio,
hustled along in steady pursuit along the outside around the turn, raced wide into upper stretch then drifted in near the furlong marker, came under left
handed urging and moved back out and finished well clear over the rest. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ hustled up away from the gate but lacked early kick and
raced in the back, saved ground down the backstretch then angled out moving through the turn, raced four wide upper stretch and offered no late rally.
NICHOLAS ROSE took the rail spot just after the start and moved up the inside to take over the early lead, challenged by eventual winner leaving the
backstretch, could not move on with rival mid-way through the turn then had nothing left in late reserve and tired.

Footnotes
UNCLE CURLY eyed the battling leaders going to the far turn, ranged up three wide to challenge past the quarter-pole, lugged in through upper stretch in
front of GOOD SOLUTION, continued to lug in tightening things up on MR STARK, then swerved out sharply and continued erratically to the wire. MR
STARK argued the pace inside GOOD SOLUTION from the start, battled back to get the lead after being headed by the latter late on the far turn, steadied
along the rail in midstretch and was coming back on UNCLE CURLY in the closing yards. GOOD SOLUTION contested the pace outside MR STARK to the
top of the lane, checked when UNCLE CURLY came over in front of him in upper stretch, and saved the show while weakening. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE)
raced three to four wide on the turns, and rallied mildly on the far outside for a share. GOLDENLINEOF saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid bid.
WOLF RIDGE was reserved early three wide, and lacked the needed response when roused. LONDON WEREWOLF was no factor through an inside
journey. Run-up unavailable. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS OF MR STARK AND GOOD SOLUTION
AGAINST UNCLE CURLY, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
SWEET MIA moved between foes and assumed command in early stages, cleared on top and led the way into the turn, challenged by MUDSLIDE WICKED
past the quarter pole, dug in for more and turned back bid then stayed sharp and pulled away. MUDSLIDE WICKED broke on top, vied in opening strides
then conceded position to SWEET MIA, remained forwardly placed and hustled along in pursuit of the leader around the turn, raced in striking range
entering top stretch then failed to sustain up close position, weakened off the winner but had enough in reserve to stay on for place. UNCAPTURED RUBY
briefly matched strides out of the gate then hustled along and raced in pursuit of the leader through the backstretch, chased the top pair under steady
pressure around the turn, came out wider for the drive, continued a steady outside bid and secured share. LAKE PARIMA was away in good order then
dropped back off the early pace, hustled along in steady pursuit around the turn, drifted in a couple paths upper stretch, came back out under left handed
pressure near the furlong marker, kept on with interest but needed more for late impact. FASHION FRAME raced inside of the second flight going by the
five-eighths marker, raced under pressure and saved ground around the turn, stayed on under a drive two wide top stretch then evened out. FLOWZANO
chased after the top flight through early stages, failed to advance position around the turn then entered top stretch driving five wide, drifted in a couple paths
and gave way. I'M A GINGER raced four to five wide off the early pace, remained along the outside around the turn and failed to gain a threatening position
in the lane. RYE STREET lacked early foot and raced in the back, stayed in the rear around the turn, moved into stretch five wide and failed to move into
contention. GINGERONMYMIND raced off the pace and widest moving through the backstretch, stayed near the rear, moved into stretch four wide and
lacked response. SILVER PALACE was off a step slow at the start, chased along the inside through early stages, stayed near the inside around the turn
then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
DANZING DUNHILL saved ground in range early, moved out three wide rallying off the far turn, forged past the leaders in deep stretch and pulled clear.
JUSTINTHENICKOTIME set a pressured pace inside BLING SEEKER, edged away through upper stretch, could not contain the winner but held on well.
BLING SEEKER pressed the pace in the two-path from the start, and fought on past the furlong marker before weakening between the top two finishers.
UPHAM cut the corner into the stretch, moved out and bumped with DECLARE UNION through the furlong grounds, and finished evenly. LETS PLAY
HARDBALL raced three to four wide on the turns, and did not menace through an even effort. BEACH TRAFFIC broke open the gate prior to the start, raced
well back to the stretch, and improved past tired horses. DECLARE UNION raced three to four wide in range to the stretch, bumped with UPHAM near the
eighth-pole and gave way. HERO'S RETURN lodged a mild bid on the far turn while three wide and between horses, but faltered through the drive.
NEXTSTOP POKIPC broke slowly, raced four then five wide through the far turn, and could not reach contention. ST. PADDY'S DADDY raced well back
early, drifted out very wide having trouble cornering past the quarter-pole, and remained outrun. ENANO ASTRAY was finished early inside. FIRE FIST
brushed the left side of the gate and was slow to begin, took the first turn four wide at the rear, and lost contact with the field despite urging.

Footnotes
HARTLING broke out at the start, was forwardly placed racing behind the leader down the backstretch, let out a notch and advanced to assume command
nearing the midway point around the turn, came under right handed pressure upper stretch, stayed sharp in response and finished clear. DUNIVERSE rated
under a snug hold in early stages then moved up between foes to engage the second flight near the half mile marker, headed in pursuit three wide around
the turn, stayed on with response under steady pressure in late stages and secured place. PAOLA'S TEAM sped to the lead and set the pace with
HARTLING not far away, remained the leader leaving the backstretch then got collared past the three eighths pole, continued a bid up the inside upper
stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. DON'T GET KHOZY bumped the side of the gate at the start, raced in tracking mode off the top pair down the
backstretch, coaxed four wide around the turn, kept on with interest in the drive but needed more for late impact. LA TRES JOLIE steadied steps out of the
gate, raced in the rear through early stages, prompted to pick up the pace racing four wide late backstretch, failed to respond then raced four wide into
upper stretch and offered no late run. ANGELIC KNUGGET hit the gate and momentarily lost some balance at the start, raced in range and tracked the top
flight down the backstretch, quickly retreated around the turn then taken to the far outside and not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
VALDOLOBO (IRE) settled nicely just off the early leaders, moved off the inside approaching the stretch with aim at JOYFUL HEART, wrested command
through the furlong grounds and edged clear under pressure. JOYFUL HEART established the pace inside, could not match strides with the winner entering
the last furlong, but held well to clearly best the others. BLOCKBUSTER raced in the second flight early two wide, swung to the four-path leaving the far
turn, and rallied into third with a mild response. SKY D raced three wide on the turns, and lacked the needed late bid. BODIE CODY went along in the
second flight to the stretch, and was no menace. BAD BOY E. J. was never involved and showed little. SHANGHAI LEVI prompted the pace outside to the
far turn, and gave way approaching the stretch. GONE DIESEL was forwardly placed two wide early, and dropped back through the far turn. Run-up
distance unavailable.

Footnotes
MR. CESCO was allowed to settle out of the gate then steadily advanced through the backstretch, raced in contention while patiently handled around the
turn, prompted two wide between rivals entering top stretch, got through then took the rail position, raced in striking distance of SHANGHAI MOON in the
final furlong then edged by deep stretch under firm handling. SHANGHAI MOON prompted out of the gate and advanced to duel for the early lead, battled
outside of CONGRATS THAT down the backstretch then held a slight edge and raced under strong pressure from both sides at the quarter pole, turned for
home three wide then dug in with a slight edge at the furlong marker, continued to battle back gamely then got wore down in final stages. MAKABIM drifted
in sharply at the start and lost ground, hustled up and quickly advanced into closer contention, raced in pursuit along the outside around the turn, stayed
outside under firm left handed pressure in final furlong, steadily edged up closer and gained show. DR G'S HOPE stalked the top two leaders down the
backstretch, prompted and advanced to race in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, remained in pursuit and vied for the lead near the furlong grounds then
flattened in final stages and lost show. CONGRATS THAT dueled for the lead in opening stages with SHANGHAI MOON, continued to battle for the lead
down the backstretch and around the far turn, cut the corner entering top stretch then lost position and had nothing left in late reserve. ST JOE VIPER
showed response through early stages then came up empty after the half. PRIZED WARRIOR raced in the back and saved ground through early stages
and around the turn, came off the inside entering top stretch and offered no late bid.

Footnotes
STUNNING SKY was on hold early between horses at the back, moved three then four wide to contention around the far turn, kept SECURE
CONNECTION pinned in through upper stretch and again through the furlong grounds, and drove past GINGER KITTY late under crafty handling. GINGER
KITTY vied outside CEE'S OVERTURE from the beginning, bested that one leaving the far turn, moved inside and held stubbornly to save second.
SECURE CONNECTION saved ground unhurried for six furlongs, moved off the rail near the quarter-pole, found herself pinned in behind QUEEN FIELD by
STUNNING SKY in upper stretch and again a furlong out, altered course inward to the two-path and just missed the place. QUEEN FIELD tracked the
leaders inside for six furlongs, moved out three wide to loom a threat into the stretch, battled on past the eighth-pole but was outkicked late. LEMON SCAT
had the two-path on the turns, steadied near the quarter-pole and offered nothing further. CEE'S OVERTURE set the pace hounded by GINGER KITTY,
and gave way in upper stretch. OUR LITTLE JEWEL had the three-path on the turns, steadied near the quarter-pole and dropped back.

Footnotes
MRS. MAISEL was forwardly placed along the rail in early going then dropped into the second flight and saved ground around the turn, angled out turning
for home then shifted five wide upper stretch, came under strong right handed pressure, drew clear and held on. RICHIES GREAT GIRL raced along the
outside through early stages then raced three deep around the turn, shifted out wider for a clear path top stretch, responded under strong handling and
closed with a rush. PALACE TWO STEP got bumped at the start, pressed the early pace then vied for the lead with SILVER TUNES around the turn, roused
to a brief lead in the final furlong then quickly lost the top spot to the winner. SILVER TUNES got bumped at the start, held a slim lead in early stages then
vied for the lead with PALACE TWO STEP around the turn, battled back upper stretch then gave way in late stages. R SEA SMOKE raced off the early
speed, saved ground around the turn then shifted out three wide and improved position. FREE THE BEAST chased between rivals in early stages,
continued between foes then weakened out of flight late turn, kept under a ride two to three wide in stretch, moved by a couple foes but needed more for
impact. TANGLED TALE raced along the rail and steadied in early stages, stayed inside and saved ground around the turn, gained position upper stretch
then switched out a couple paths and gave way. PATTY HEANEY raced in the last flight, moved into stretch five wide and lacked a needed rally. FLASH
MONEY broke in and bumped with rival at the start, raced up close in opening stages, flattened into the second flight moving through the turn then
weakened in the lane. ONE HOT DRAMA hustled along and chased in range along the outside through the turn then came up tired in the drive.
