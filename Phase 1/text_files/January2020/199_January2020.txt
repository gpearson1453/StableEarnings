Footnotes
SAMMY'S MINESHAFT angled inwards in the opening stages while moving to terms with the pacesetter prompting that foe through the backstretch,
pressed the issue through the bend to gain the advantage in upper stretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. TARTAN THE BULL broke
outwards bumping EMMETT'S DREAM, was urged to track just off the first flight three deep between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide racing
through the bend and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. EMMETT'S DREAM hopped while being bumped at the start, angled
inwards to gain a position in the second flight between foes just off the inside racing to the turn, was urged to advance racing into the turn, shifted inwards a
bit exchanging contact with DEFICIT HAWK midway through the turn, lodged a bid inside the leaders but was outkicked in the closing stages. WILD
WINTER settled last along the rail, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch, then advanced inside foes while in close quarters through the final
stages but continued with interest to improve position. TEPU WAR, urged to the lead from between foes racing in the three path on the backstretch, dueled
for command a bit off the rail to upper stretch and gave way. CHESTER MON tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn and soon faded. DEFICIT
HAWK angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the leaders, was urged inside foes to advance racing into the turn, then was bumped soundly and
forced to check out of tight quarter midway through the turn and quickly dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
DAS DA ONE broke readily, sped to the fore racing a bit off the rail to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, went clear on
his own courage leaving the midway point of the far turn to open a comfortable advantage and held sway through the lane under one left handed tap and
some hand urging. HIGH ROLLING DUDE tracked just off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, then was
prompted to advance in that path through the far turn to the lane to prove best of the others. MULLED WINE tracked just off the pacesetter three deep to the
backstretch, continued in pursuit into the far turn but weakened racing into the stretch. OSVALDO, urged to a forward placing along the inside, steadily
faded racing into the far turn. SUPER SUPER LUCKY shifted into the path of WHITECAP BAY while brushing that rival at the start, raced four wide between
foes through the first turn to the backstretch and dropped out nearing the far turn. WHITECAP BAY, brushed at the start, was caught five wide racing into
the first turn and soon retreated. BEN OF THE BUSH tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn and emptied out into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BITCOIN PASSION (IRE) was guided to the rail in early stages settling well off the leaders for a half, shifted off the inside nearing the far turn, advanced
three deep between foes on the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch gathering momentum, lugged inwards a bit despite left handed
pressure but readily took charge under firm handling to go clear in time. BUY ME CANDY, bumped at the start, angled to the inside racing to the backstretch
settling well back early, gained some position inside foes after a half, briefly awaited an opening on the far turn, shifted out to split foes just off the inside
racing into the stretch then shifted three deep late while gaining the place honors in the final strides. KENTUCKY GHOST, forwardly placed just outside the
leaders, angled to the rail racing into the backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter in tandem with several rivals nearing upper stretch to bid between foes,
gained a brief advantage but lacked the needed final kick. CURLIN'S THRILL settled last to the backstretch, gained some position between foes just off the
inside leaving the far turn, lost some momentum racing in close quarters entering the lane but continued with interest between foes to gain some position
late. JOEY PADRINO sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, then gave way once headed racing into
upper stretch. QUID tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, was fanned five, then six wide racing into upper stretch and gained some
position in an even effort. FUSED, pulling a bit early, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced in tandem with
several rivals to challenge four wide nearing upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. SINATRA DEVIL angled inwards to track between foes off the
second flight racing to the backstretch but faded entering the lane. LASTFORTINOFAMILY tracked off the second flight along the inside, raced in close
quarters inside foes in late stages and had no rally. ON BASE, restless in the gate, proved no factor. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS never seriously menaced.
HEY SACH pulled his way to a forward placing along the inside, was prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid between foes nearing upper stretch but
quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
LEGACY AZTECA was rated off the first flight racing off the inside in the opening three furlongs, angled inwards entering the turn while being urged to
advance between foes, split rivals nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage and went clear under firm handling. LEM ME TEL YA broke sharply, set the
pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, dueled for command three deep between foes to upper stretch and proved best of the others.
SPRING UP settled off the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out five wide entering the turn while being prompted to advance, continued
in that path to upper stretch and flattened out late. MY COWBOY angled to the rail early while being urged to prompt the pace inside foes racing into the
turn, then gave way into the lane. WILD WIGGLIN JACK was a brief factor five wide tracking just off the leaders to the turn but soon faded. SILVER
DEFENSE switched out early to track outside the pacesetter, was prompted to lodge a brief bid four wide between foes entering the turn but soon gave way.
STOCK trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MORGAN'S Z VA broke sharply, prompted the pace between foes into the backstretch, forged clear into upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the
end under firm encouragement. MARMALADE tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, advanced four wide racing into the far turn to upper stretch
and continued willingly to close the gap late. IGOTTAWHITEFACE settled outside foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance outside foes on the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to gain a share. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE, forwardly placed
three deep prompting the pace to the far turn, pressed the issue between foes in that path to upper stretch and weakened late. SHOWBOATING tracked
just off the first flight along the inside for five furlongs, was shuffled a bit behind a tiring foe leaving the midway point of the far turn, then angled out four wide
racing into the stretch while floating out BALADA but gaining position to the end. BALADA, restless in the gate, then rank against restraint between foes in
the opening stages, was steadied out of tight quarters nearing the first turn to track off the second flight along the rail into the backstretch, shifted out while
briefly awaiting an opening on the far turn, then was carried five wide racing into the stretch while continuing with some interest to improve position.
TEARLESS tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, was urged to advance racing into the stretch but steadily faded late. LADY LOVE,
reserved outside foes in early stages, was fanned six wide racing into upper stretch and proved no real threat. PURE SUGAR, urged to dispute the pace
inside foes from the outset into the backstretch, emptied out racing into the far turn. SPEEDING STARLET was settled along the inside to the backstretch
and offered no rally.

BRIDLEWISE, bumped by ELUSIVE AURA while forced into MY COTTON CANDY at the start, settled into stride racing well off the leaders, was prompted
to advance nearing the turn while shifting out four wide, steadily gained position between foes advancing in tandem with MY COTTON CANDY racing into
upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and edged forward late under brisk handling a in a long drive. MY COTTON CANDY, bumped soundly at the
start, switched out five wide tracking off the second flight racing to the turn, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner in that path through the turn to
upper stretch and was just outkicked in a prolonged drive. OUR PETUNIA, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the pacesetter while readily
moving to terms with that foe entering the bend, was prompted to take over nearing upper stretch but faltered nearing midstretch. VICTIM, forwardly placed
three wide racing to the turn, faded between foes into upper stretch. REINA LA KELSY settled last in the opening stages, angled out five wide racing into
upper stretch and improved her position. TRACK MAGIC, urged between rivals pursuing the leaders three deep into the turn, continued evenly to late
stages. ALL THIS JAZZ settled near the inside early, angled out six wide in upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. ELUSIVE AURA broke in bumping the
eventual winner, was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the turn and emptied out into upper stretch. SUSIES WHO tracked off the first flight outside
foes early, angled inwards racing into the turn and soon gave way. MISS LOTUS FLOWER proved no threat. INTRICATELY angled inside in the opening
stages tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but gave way early.

Footnotes
EARTHQUAKE was reserved in the last flight racing outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn, swung out five wide
in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to reel in CHAOS KID and edge that foe in time under firm left handed encouragement. The latter was
rated tracking the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced into the far turn to bid for command between
foes nearing upper stretch, went clear between calls late and just failed to contain the winner. DOHKO tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight in
the opening half, advanced on the far turn to challenge four wide nearing upper stretch but couldn't produce the needed final kick while prevailing for a
share. VERY REPLACEABLE settled last while angling to the inside early, shifted out entering the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the far turn and
improved his position between rivals just off the inside in late stages. FUNNEL CLOUD, forwardly placed just outside the pacesetter tracking that rival,
lodged a brief bid between foes three deep nearing upper stretch but gave way into the lane. AGRIPINO shied inwards at the break bumping ONE CRAZY
RIDE, was righted quickly, then sped to the lead along the inside, dueled for command inside foes nearing upper stretch and gave way late. MR. HAND
FULL worked his way to the inside nearing the backstretch, steadied approaching the six furlong marker, then again nearing the three furlong marker and
had no rally. ONE CRAZY RIDE, restless in the gate, was bumped at the start, then held up out of close quarters while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch but retreated early. COMPOUND INTEREST tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
CHART broke readily to dictate the pace outside foes on a narrow margin in the opening stages, lost the advantage nearing the turn, continued with a
steady effort while being fanned four wide into the stretch to regain the advantage, lugged inwards a bit despite left handed pressure but went well clear in
the final sixteenth. SHARI'S TUNE broke outwards bumping SISTER OTOOLE, was righted to race between foes, then was hustled between foes to gain a
clear lead racing into the turn, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's bid but soon proved no match. SISTER OTOOLE, bumped at the start,
switched out to race off the second flight five wide through the backstretch, then continued in that path into the stretch to improve her position in the final
stages. SENSE A MILLION tracked the pace between foes in second flight, shifted out four wide racing into the lane but lacked the needed late kick.
OPTIMAS angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and steadily faded. WEST BURKE
switched off the inside early tracking off the second flight but proved no threat. SWEET FOR CERTAIN was a brief factor four wide tracking just off the
leaders but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BIG ANGEL was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced racing into the far turn to split rivals four wide, bid for
command in that path racing into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage outside CLASSY OF COURSE and held that rival gamely to the end under brisk
handling to prevail. The latter was rated off the second flight while shifting just off the inside, steadily gained position between foes racing into the far turn,
was steadied in tight quarters nearing upper stretch, shifted inside foes to bid inside the eventual winner in upper stretch and contested the issue to the end
to just miss. IRISH ORB was rated between foes, then angled to the inside racing to the backstretch to track the leaders from just out of striking distance,
was shuffled a bit behind a tiring foe leaving the midway point of the far turn, came around that rival while being urged to advance inside rivals in the lane
and made some mild progress late. FLORIDA RUST was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing into
upper stretch and improved position. KELCIE'S MANDATE tracked the pace outside foes in second flight in early stages, gained position three deep
between foes to lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but soon flattened out. JUST CHILL, pulling against restraint while racing four wide through the first turn,
tracked off the leaders between foes in second flight, lodged a brief bid between rivals midway through the far turn but came up empty in the drive.
ALEXACRAT, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch but made no impact. K KITCHEN tracked off the
pacesetter inside foes in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid along the rail when presented an opening entering the far turn but quickly emptied
out. CALYPSO KEY tracked just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, was carried out by that foe racing into the far turn and was quickly taken up
losing all momentum. WILDCAT MERRY pulled her way to the lead despite firm restraint racing to the backstretch, bore out racing into the far turn impeding
CALYPSO KEY and quickly gave way.
