SEA SERENADE (GB) outside advancement to far turn but also flattened out in the drive. MOTOWN WINGS well placed to the half, lost position far turn
with no late gain. SMASHVILLE getting out first turn while far back, rallied to improve position late. TURKICANUS FREAK was through early and faded
back. OUTRAGEOUSEVENT was also through early and gave way. BLUNT BRUNETTE bore out bumped start and never a factor. HIDDEN STRENGTH

eighth pole, gave in nearing the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner in the final stages. BIG FUDGE chased the pace early, shifted into the three
path in the turn and moved up in the stretch run. EQUAL JUSTICE chased the pace early, came out entering the lane and cut off ODIE and lacked any late
gain in the stretch drive. ODIE stalked the pace early, was cut off by EQUAL JUSTICE into the lane and faded late in the drive. ECHO ALPHA SIX was
fractious in the gate during the pre-start and trailed the field throughout.
