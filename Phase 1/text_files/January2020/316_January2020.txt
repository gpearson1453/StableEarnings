Footnotes
RED AGAIN broke on top, soon got clear, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way second turn, maintained daylight through the lane
while drifting out and under steady handling. FROST OR FRIPPERY settled behind the pace while in the two path, set down for the drive. KENZOU'S
RHYTHM broke out, was straightened to race closest to the leader just off the inside, dropped inside when straightened for home, lacked a winning kick.
TAPITOR lacked speed while off the inside, displayed some modest late interest to improve position, not a major factor. CARMELO off step slow, raced
toward the inside and failed to threaten. CANDY MY BOY within striking distance while racing in the three path, had little left for the drive. TALES OF WAR
was never a threat. HIGH RISK STRATEGY bothered, off slow, trailed much of the way and was never a factor. GOT MOJO was finished early.

Footnotes
TRACI'S GREELEY lacked speed, dropped inside turn, continued to save some ground into the lane, split foes, proved best in a determined effort. LIL
RESPECT behind the first flight off the inside, three wide into the lane, challenged on the outside soon after, narrowly showed the way past the furlong
marker, outkicked in the late going. LAURIEANN within striking distance, raced three wide through the turn, challenged between rivals turning for home, vied
past the furlong marker, also did not have enough late. HEFFINGTON void of speed, came on the outside exiting the turn, improved position while well out
in the strip. SOUTHERN CENTS forced the issue in the run up the backstretch between horses, showed the way through the bend while closest to the
inside, faltered in the drive. SHESHED broke alertly, also raced with the pace while outside, backed up in the drive as well. SAVVY SPENDER went one
paced while racing in the two path. AZLYNN'S DREAMER flashed speed along the inside, fell back off the leaders in the turn, moved out, two path entering
the stretch, faded. GYPSY WIND JEANNE remained always back while racing along the inside. ANIMATOR off a step slow, never a factor. PLUS SIZE
VALUE tired while racing three wide. DEDE'S TRICK finished before a half while just off the inside.

Footnotes
MADISON WAY bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to be forwardly placed while wide early, continued in the four path while prompting the issue through
the bend, dueled past the furlong marker, showed good determination late while drifting out to hold late. STERLING MISS off a step slow, raced back while
well out in the strip, four wide exiting the turn when beginning to rally, finished well down the middle of the strip while too late. TIZANILLUSION broke alertly,
cleared to the inside, showed the way into the turn, held a narrow advantage exiting the turn, dueled past the furlong marker then weakened late. C P
QUALITY in mid pack early, saved some ground through the turn, lacked serious kick. JOSIE THE E F FIVE saved ground to no avail. SWEET TATUM
pressed in the two path, faded in the drive. EURODEVILWOMAN fractious prior to the start, off slow, trailed throughout, far back.

Footnotes
DICHOTOMY settled off the pace and the inside, three out to four wide exiting the turn, set down, finished with good energy to kick down the leader.
DESTINY'S LOVE broke out then in to bother a rival, quickly moved up the inside to clear, continued to show the way through the turn and into the stretch,
maintained daylight until late when unable to contain the winner, held sway for the place. LUNA FORTIS in mid pack for a half toward the inside, in some
traffic late in the turn, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. CIPHERIN' SUE bothered at the start to be away slowly, raced back and inside, continued
along the rail and improved up the inside while not a serious threat. MISS XIMENA closest to the runner up off the inside, crept closer to that from the
outside late in the turn, hung in the drive. BAUDETTE within striking distance in the early going, had little left for the drive. M AND M GIRL broke back,
improved position slightly while never a serious threat. CRUMLIN TIME forwardly placed for a half, gave way. DESPINA raced back and off the inside, five
wide turning for home, tired. DESHA in mid pack off rail, four wide and between rivals exiting the turn, backed up. ETTALUSIVE was never involved.
FRANKI D ORO off a step slow, finished early.

Footnotes
TURNSTONE bumped at the start, raced back early, began a steady advance before a half, four out to five wide exiting turn, up in time. CHOCTAW
CHARLIE vied up front along the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear past the furlong marker, just failed to hold the winner safe, clearly second
best. TOO PRETTY dueled up front off the inside, began to weaken nearing the furlong marker, saved the show. LORI'S EYES bit fractious loading, broke
in good order, within striking distance four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, came up empty for the stretch run. CINNAFRIJOLE behind the first flight off
the inside, raced in traffic and three wide late in the bend, weakened slightly in the drive. MISS CASEY BETH fractious while loading, broke with the field,
four wide turn, failed to rally. DIXIE WAYNE lacked speed, made little impact. FIVE QUEENS tired in the drive. HISSY MISSY broke back, was always
outrun. ZANSHOES off a step slow, remained always back. LAURA BELLE forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat before a half.
ALLOFOURDREAMS gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
BAJAN CASH outrun in the early going, advanced late in the turn, was fanned six wide into the lane, finished full of run to win going away. SACRED KIKI
BIRD washy in setting the pace up the backstretch, shook clear turning for home, proved no match for the winner, saved the place.
TENTWELVEFOURTEEN lacked speed toward the inside, moved out a bit late in the turn, steered widest when straightened for home, finished willingly to
be getting to the runner up late. TOUCH OF DISNEY off the pace, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, lacked the needed response when clear for
the drive. ESPOSITO settled off the pace, in some traffic late in the turn, went also finished up in even fashion in failing to respond. MATCH PLAY squeezed
back at the start, trailed early, continued to race back, displayed some belated interest after the issue had been decided despite rider losing whip in
midstretch. R H SMOAKEM well back, passed some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. PARK RIDGE BENNY had little left for the drive. BOLD
FRIENDS pressured the runner up from the outside for a half and weakened. SPEEDY DANSMERE settled toward the front along the inside, gave way in
the drive. COLLECTION was finished early. IOWA NATIVE forwardly placed while four wide turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CABERTOSS close up from the start inside, moved out, took over in the two path into the far turn in hand, shook clear soon after, maintained daylight to the
wire under steady handling. JAY VEE BEE void of early foot, angled out three wide when advancing late in the final turn, finished willingly to earn the place.
LNGTERMRELATIONSHP within striking distance, three wide into the lane, could not do much with the winner in the drive, outkicked late for the place,
gained the nod for the show. ONE LAST STRIKE prompted the pace off the inside, had little left for the drive. FRA MAURO back off the pace along the
inside into the first turn, raced in mid pack while remaining toward the inside, crept a bit closer in the two final turn, came up empty for the stretch run.
STARRING JOHN WAIN saved ground to no avail. PEPPERED five down to four wide in the first turn when racing back off the pace, also lacked a rally.
HARD TO PARK settled in mid pack early, failed to respond. COLOMBARD broke well, set the pace inside, gave way when headed. SOLOMONIC
remained always back. MAJORS VINDICATION was finished after a half. HOLLYWOOD STAR off slow, trailed, sluggish, distanced after losing contact with
the field.

Footnotes
FIRE CORAL allowed the pace to to early, advanced then was roused three wide for the drive, closed resolutely, challenged late and drew clear.
CHEROKEE MAIDEN stalked the leader just off the inside, advanced, took over second turn, shook well clear, offered brief resistance to the winner late
then could not match strides. GLAMOUR GIRL rated off the pace toward the inside, advanced while inside the winner into the stretch, steadied briefly
between the top two with a sixteenth remaining and finished up evenly. HASHTAG WINNER devoid of any early foot, swung five wide into the lane, staged a
mild rally to improve position. AUCTION FEVER went evenly in lacking a closing response while out in the strip. AREEMAA four wide through much of the
first turn, lacked speed, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CURLS AND BOWS broke well, sprinted clear soon after, set the pace until
headed in the final turn, gave way. LADY MCKENZIE remained back and was never dangerous. UNBURNT was also never involved. CHALDEA void of
early foot, continued well back, distanced after losing contact with the field in the stretch. MARTZ'S MAE stopped after a half, distanced in the stretch as well
when far back. A J ROCK forwardly placed, gave way abruptly in the stretch, pulled up.
