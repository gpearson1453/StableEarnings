SHANNON'S GIRL four to five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in rallying latched on to FUNDERELLA to the outside and overthrew the leader as a tandem just inside the
eighth pole, knocked heads through to the finish and got the nod on the wire. FUNDERELLA chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to be loosely between foes near the eighth pole and took command just inside that station, dueled
through to the finish with the aforementioned foe but lost the bob on the line. HICKORY MADE four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, took over
command at the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat from a pair to the outside, got collared just inside the
eighth pole and weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. SASSY SECRET coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed three then
two wide, yielded the front with five-sixteenths remaining, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. FLYING PLEASANTLY chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. STUNNING BEAUTY coaxed from the start, chased just off the
inside, tucked inside put to coaxing half a mile from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. Please note HICKORY MADE raced

badly at the start, moved by the winner then tucked along the inside route early on the backstretch, showed the way, with the aforementioned opponent
having assumed the role of primary pursuer, got turned loose for the drive home, saw its advantage get sliced into by the top one, yielded with less than a
furlong to go, stayed on for the place. MYSTIC MOVES bobbled after lunging at the start, settled into the two path by the conclusion of the backstretch,
chased the pace from midpack on the turn, was fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response to claim the show award.
BELLA DOMENICA forwardly placed three wide for nearly six furlongs, stepped into the lane, failed to make any headway and weakened. TAKE CHARGE
DONNA much like BEAUTIFUL KAREN, was badly comprised at the start due to pressure from an incoming ROSEY'S INVASION, got carried in while
bumped and was eventually checked, travelled in path three in the turn, was shifted inward for the drive home, lacked the necessary response. ROSEY'S
INVASION came in sharply after losing its footing springing from the gate, making contact with others and forcing them towards the rail, cut over to the
inside herself, faltered off the subsequent ground-saving journey. SAFFRON GIRL sent onto the inside route shortly after leaving the chute, was asked for
some run on the bend, failed to respond appreciably and backed away.

Footnotes
WHERE'S RUDY broke a beat slow and was sluggish early briefly taken in hand and altered inwards as SO SUBLIME took over the lane in front, came
under coaxing conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide down the backstretch advancing mildly to mid pack
before ranging up to split foes vying for command on the front end to take command just inside the half mile pole, tucked to the two path through the turn
coaxed along and began to shake away near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to the finish and was geared
down in the late going. BUSINESS CYCLE six paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the front, tucked four wide into the turn and came under
coaxing at the three-eighths advancing to apply pressure to the aforementioned foe, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top
one, weakened to the finish and prevailed in the battle for the place honors. MONEYMEISTER vied four then three wide among a quartet, came under
coaxing at the half mile pole when WHERE'S RUDY advanced on the scene, chased through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while fighting on for the place honors, got bested for that share while clear of the rest for the show honors. BOOTLEGGER (FR) vied from the
five path with a trio, came under coaxing half a mile from home, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. POSHSKY chased two to three wide under a ride
from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SO SUBLIME hustled from the gate, vied from the two path, tucked inside
put to coaxing at the half mile pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. HOLY WEEK four wide early on, darted to the inside five furlongs
out, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. CHAMPAGNE PAPI seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PLAYWRIGHT off the inside throughout, pursued the front runners three to four wide on the turn, was more the latter spinning into the lane, kicked in when
given his response, arriving at the eighth pole on near even terms with the ones to catch, cemented itself to the top a few strides later, edged away to a
comfortable advantage before being geared down for much of the last sixteenth. BEACH ACCESS gradually made his way to the inside route, tracked the
front runners from midpack, flashed some interest as three-quarters was being completed, went into the stretch and rallied for the place. SHOCK THERAPY
saved ground for the opening six furlongs, shifted to the outside during the stretch run until approximately five wide, finished well enough to be along for
third. RUN FOR BOSTON took up the chase primarily from the two path on the backstretch, got steered into the third one after BIG THICKET took up
residence in path two at the top of the turn, made it into the stretch, got sent out six wide during the stretch drive, closed in for the last major check. HIGH
COMMAND vied for control from along the rail, got set down when put to the test by BEBE BANKER as they approached the quarter pole, held out on the
lead until a slight distance beyond the furlong marker, weakened steadily after releasing the advantage. BEBE BANKER sparred from the two path while
matched up with HIGH COMMAND, challenged heading home, wasn't up to the task at hand and backed away. TIZGAME chased the pace three wide on
the turn, inched its way into path four from upper to midlane not making any headway and soon gave way. BIG THICKET worked out a tuck into the two
path at the top of the turn, ventured onward to the head of the stretch, had no rally.

SIR WINSTON four wide at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, tipped out from in behind BRASS COMPASS near the three-sixteenths and bumped with ROAMING UNION who was attempting to keep
him inside, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking over at the sixteenth marker and edged clear to the finish to prevail. MUSICAL
AMERICA broke in at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide from just off the pace coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole, got
set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and could not get by LEITONE until the
top one did, then ran on to secure the place honors. LEITONE (CHI) established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed in the two path, tucked inside
half a mile from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat fending off MUSICAL AMERICA when displaced by SIR WINSTON at
the sixteenth pole, then kept on clear for the show honors. ROAMING UNION chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, attempted to keep SIR WINSTON in behind BRASS COMPASS at the three-sixteenths, had
that rival tip out and was bumped at that station, then weakened through to the finish. BON RAISON chased five then four wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SMALL BEAR chased two to three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. BRASS COMPASS bobbled at the start, chased three then two wide coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and folded. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on SIR WINSTON in upper stretch before the result
stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
MINE THE COIN sat reserved two wide during the initial stages, narrowed in late on the bend, bid approximately three wide turning into the lane, took over
during the ensuing furlong, held late to preserve the decision. SNEADS settled into midpack after the field had been sent off and running, stepped four wide
onto the turn, departed it by tipping one path farther off the rail, closed in steadfastly rallying for the place. SPLITTING EIGHTS brushed with TIO BLAS after
scraping the left side of the gate, went on to dispute the pace to the outside of LOADED JOE, vanquished that rival and tucked along the rail, showed the
way with the pilot holding something back, was asked for more feeling an uptick in pressure as the third fraction was being finalized, proved powerless to
stave off the winner, tired in the final furlong yet salvaged the show. SEEDISKID remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent off
and running, closed the gap during the run around the bend, with the pace having slowed down quite significantly, was in hand angling three wide into the
lane, mustered up a mild response when given his cue to earn fourth money. MR. MIKE three wide entering the turn, got steered out four wide exiting it,
tired. TIO BLAS saved ground for a good portion of the trip leading up to the five-sixteenths pole after bumping lightly with SPLITTING EIGHTHS, was
maneuvered into path five from that station to the three-sixteenths pole, had no offering afterwards and gave way. LOADED JOE was along the inside
arguing for the top against SPLITTING EIGHTHS, fell back on the turn, tipped out two wide heading home, continued to fall back.
