Footnotes
CURLIN GREY broke out and bumped with a foe, was in tight between foes early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the slow pace,
came under urging and was the first of the field to do so leaving the backstretch, raced under a vigorous hand ride while two to three wide on the far turn,
turned into the stretch under a drive then came under the whip, gained under vigorous handling into the final furlong, dropped to the rail near the
sixteenth-pole and got up in a prolonged drive. FIST OF RAGE tugged at the bit while keen under restraint against the rail on the first turn, was rated just off
the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked while shifting four wide into the stretch, chased under the whip into the final furlong, took
the lead shortly thereafter, switched back to his inside lead while still in front into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. AL TAWEEL
bumped with a rival just after the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, was
given his cue at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. LEMON BLITZ bumped with foes on both sides just
after the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a tight hold, was asked outside the three-eighths, engaged the
leader in the two to three path on the far turn, took the advantage at the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost the lead shortly thereafter
and weakened then just lost the show. CALL THE COLONEL came out in front but wasn't asked for speed and was allowed to drop back and give up
position early, checked between horses on the initial straightaway, raced inside into the turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide later on that
bend, settled well behind the rest of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path, was finally asked at the five-sixteenths, angled out inside the
three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. HOMEFORTHEWEEKEND went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while five wide
on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. DICKINSON'S IMAGE strolled to the front, set the pace through tepid fractions while inside
to the two path, came under increased pressure to his outside on the far turn, was asked while being headed at the quarter-pole, battled into the final furlong
under a drive then gave way.

Footnotes
OFFSPRING broke out and brushed a foe at the start, went to the front, set the pace in the two path while in hand, was let out a notch coming to the
quarter-pole, extended the advantage into upper stretch, responded well when asked outside the furlong marker, drew off under a moderate hand ride into
the final sixteenth then was eased up significantly while much the best. PLAYIN N TRAFFIC brushed with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the
two path, tracked the pace while inside of ALY'S CHARM, chased in the three path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong
and proved no match while far clear for the place. FUHRCRY saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, angled five wide under strong urging on the
far turn and failed to respond while best of the rest. ALY'S CHARM went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back under
urging late on the backstretch and stopped. FOREIGN CONNECTION went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while
three wide on the far turn and showed little. LIL ASHLEY B. veered out sharply at the start, went four wide on the first turn, dropped back while outside on
the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
KAI BABY KAI was bumped into the outside rival at the start, entered the first turn just off the leader three wide between foes then shifted in a path about
midway on that bend, raced behind the leader from off the rail entering the backstretch and placed in just a bit tight as a rival drifted moderately, switched
out four wide and was asked for run by the three-eighths, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch, edged away under steady pressure. DRILLING REPORT
exchanged a bump at the break then moved forward to dictate terms from just off the fence into the first turn, spurted clear up the backstretch still removed
from the rail, was challenged by the top of the stretch and quickly overtaken but dug in, drifted out under a left-handed whip before being straightened out
and settling for second best. M V P MOOKIE was bumped at the break, caught four to five wide around the first turn, settled off the leaders outside foes
heading up the backstretch then shifted in a bit entering the far turn, went in the three path through that bend and was asked by the top of the stretch, came
in a path and was lightly brushed in mid-stretch, kept on to get up for show honors over HALF PIPE, who settled mid-pack inside but just off the rail, was
asked for more by the five-sixteenths and took closer order nearing the quarter pole, came out a path for the drive, lacked the needed late kick. C F
JOHNATHAN was urged at the break, appeared to be forced out a bit and also getting out heading to the first turn and bumped a rival, encouraged along in
about the two to three path into the first turn, came in a bit early in the run up the backstretch and bumped a foe, continued to be ridden along three wide on
the far turn drifting out a path leaving that bend before veering in and lightly brushing a rival in mid-stretch and failed to reach contention. TUCKER THE
GROUCH was in tight and steadied slightly after the break, tucked in near but just off the rail into the first turn, was bumped early on the backstretch, went
just off the rail on the far turn and had no rally. TOTALLY ADDICTED exchanged a bump at the start, veered out entering the first turn, continued out from

MAILMAN MONEY bumped with a rival after the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front on the outside, stalked four wide on
the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, took the lead into the stretch then powered clear under a drive, switched back to his inside lead at the
furlong marker, remained well clear under a drive into the final sixteenth, swapped back to the proper lead shortly thereafter and proved much the best
under strong handling. WINNING IMPRESSION bumped with a rival after the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while
four wide early on the far turn then moved to six wide, turned into the stretch under a drive, drifted in at the furlong marker and earned the place while no
match for the winner. DEVIL'S DRAMA went five to six wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while five wide on the far turn,
drifted in near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. AUTOMATE broke in at the start, saved ground under restraint on the first turn, was
rated off the pace, came under urging near the seven-sixteenths, traveled around the far turn in the two path and came up empty. THE GRAY BLUR broke
out at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader midway down the backstretch, vied in the
three path on the far turn, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and
tired. DISCLOSURE broke out and was slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths, angled in towards the rear, saved ground under tight restraint on the
first turn, was reserved under a strong hold, saved ground on the far turn, took an awkward stride while tight against the rail outside the quarter-pole and
failed to respond. GREAT ULYSSES was carried out early then taken up some while rank into the first turn, continued keen under stout restraint in the three
path on that bend then was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the far turn and also failed to respond. KIERKEGAARD went
around the first turn in the two path, set the pace through sensible fractions, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
JET SWEEP prompted the pace from between foes three wide into the turn, began to edge clear in upper stretch when put to urging, drifted in a path at that
juncture and held while kept to task. SINCERITY switched well off the inside early tracking outside a rival in behind the leading trio early, was in close three
to four wide on the turn, angled out five deep at the head of the lane and put to strong urging, gained steadily and slowly but was too late. GRACE
FOREVER exchanged a bump at the break, was urged forward to vie for the lead inside rivals but in the two path through the turn, lost some ground in
upper stretch, altered out near the furlong marker and kept on. ORETTA exchanged contact with the aforementioned at the start, was forwardly-positioned
inside through the opening furlong then dropped back and came off the fence tracking behind the leaders and inside a rival but off the fence through the
turn, shifted in leaving that bend to be near the rail at the quarter pole before coming out a path soon thereafter, altered out several paths when GRACE
FOREVER came out near the eighth pole and ran on. GEORGIA DAWN stalked from outside foes four wide and weakened in the stretch. STELLAR VOID
was in a bit tight after the start, encouraged along after the opening three-sixteenths, went in about the two path through the turn and failed to rally.
Following an objection by the trainer of ORETTA against GRACE FOREVER alleging interference in the stretch no action was taken.

B'S TEN went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while four wide on the far turn, rallied to make an outside bid in upper stretch,
kept the runner-up blocked to her inside in the process, took the lead outside the furlong marker and was fully extended to hold off the runner-up under
strong handling. FORT POLK broke out and hit the gate at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted in the two to three path on
the far turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to inside the three-sixteenths, altered out for room near the eighth-pole, rallied on the outside in the
final furlong and closed well to just miss. YES GORGEOUS contested the early pace on the inside, was eased back off the pace late on the first turn then
switched to the outside, prompted the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, took a short lead at the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage inside the three-sixteenths, kept on well in the final furlong but was outfinished while able to get the show. ROYAL ALEXANDRA went three then
four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved up midway down the backstretch, went four then five wide on the far turn, held a reasonable
striking position under a drive into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed kick. CRIMSON FELINE contested the pace on the outside in the
two path on the first turn, set the pace under some pressure to her outside on the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost the lead at the
quarter-pole, fought on well into the final sixteenth then weakened. SNOWBALL was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far
turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, hesitated to go through a tight opening along the rail in upper stretch, was asked near the furlong marker, attempted to
get through along the rail into the final sixteenth, was unable to execute that maneuver then checked badly and lost any chance. SCOOTIN BAYOU was off
slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled at the back, went three wide early on the far turn then moved to
five wide and showed little. SAVVY SHIPMAN went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far turn,
turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SWEET CARLI broke alertly then settled in to stalk from outside, advanced four wide on the turn taking a narrow lead by the quarter pole, was thereupon
given vigorous hand-urging and responded by drawing clear before being eased up late. RUN BALLERINA tracked from outside several lengths back of the
leaders, went four to five wide on the turn asked for run leaving that bend, was no match for the winner but second best. UPGRADE ME exchanged a hard
bump at the start, shifted in up the backstretch going two to three wide and between foes into the turn, took closer order late on that bend, came out four
wide for the drive still gaining position but evened out late. VEILAZIG settled mid-division along the inside, switched outside a rival midway on the turn,
swung five deep turning into the homestretch, ran on with mild late interest. STARLIGHT SISTER moved clear early to set the pace, faced pressure from
outside foes racing just off the fence through the turn, began to weaken in upper stretch and was bumped lightly midway through the straight, lacked any
impact thereafter. KORAT QUEEN bumped the outside rival after the start, settled toward the rear racing off the inside, began to pick it up a little three to
four wide on the turn under urging, came into upper stretch six then seven deep and ran on. INDOMITABLE SPIRIT was bumped at the start, urged to
chase the pace, made a mild bid two to three wide between rivals late on the turn, drifted in a bit while weakening in mid-stretch bumping a rival and
continued to fade thereafter. CARLETTA exchanged a hard bump at the start, raced outside rivals three to four wide into the turn, was five deep late on that
bend before coming out six wide, failed to rally. OVERLY SWEET lacked early speed, went in about the two to three path on the turn and was never near
enough to threaten. MY SCARLET BEAUTY shifted in while encouraged to chase early, entered the turn in the two path coming nearer the rail by the
midpoint of that bend, dropped back and faded. FLY LIKE A BIRD bumped the outside rival at the start then was bumped by the inside foe, was soon
distanced, pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
NEWELLTON was well placed just off the pace on the inside, raced inside to the two path on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch then was asked outside
the three-sixteenths, moved to the two path under a drive in pursuit of the leader, chased that foe into final furlong, altered back towards the inside when the
leader drifted out a bit at the sixteenth-pole, made a bid soon after then fought with the runner-up in the final strides and narrowly prevailed under strong
urging. FAIRYWREN was taken in hand when FREEDOM PASSAGE passed in front early then moved out, tracked the pace on the outside, moved up to
make a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the four path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped further behind the leader into the final
furlong, gained into the final sixteenth, fought determinedly to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. AMEERAH B bumped with a rival at the
start, was hustled to the lead, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped closer to the rail,
responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, drifted out a bit while still in front entering the final sixteenth and
was caught while clear for the show. FREEDOM PASSAGE bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while
loosely between horses on the turn and tired. AWESOME ONE was hustled from the start, settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn, was
driven
four
wide
into
the
stretch,
moved
out
under
vigorous
handling
around
the
three-sixteenths
and
lacked
the
needed
response.
HERMAJESTYCOMMANDS settled at the back of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. ENDLESS ROMANCE broke a step slow,
settled towards the back on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond.
