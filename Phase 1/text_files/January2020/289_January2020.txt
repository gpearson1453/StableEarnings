Footnotes
HAVE A LIL PEPPER set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn and extended his lead while ridden out. DESPOTIC was void of early speed, went seven
wide at the top of the stretch, finished well to earn place and was no match for the winner. FRESH ONE stumbled at the start, raced in the back, angled out
for the drive and found his best stride late to get up for show. CAPITAL REEF raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace. ALWAYS WORKING
showed speed to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. KING T'CHALLA pressed the pace three across to the turn, dropped back and gave way.
WISE RIVER RAY pressed the pace while racing inside and stopped into the turn.

rally. BLITZING MARIO raced close to the pace and lacked a stretch response. RUNS WITH SCISSORS passed a tiring rival. IAMOLDFASHIONEDTO was
in tight at the start, taken outside, lacked a bid and was not urged late.

caught. WARNING BELLE raced three across to the far turn, vied to mid stretch and was unable to sustain her bid. UNBRIDLED STORMY broke slowly and
was rated back at the start, saved ground while unhurried early, angled out entering the second turn and offered a mild bid only. DAT CAT MIRACLE vied
inside to mid stretch, was crowded along the rail near the sixteenth pole and fell back. SHY saved ground, closed inside, altered course near the sixteenth
pole and failed to menace. JADEY AT THE BAR vied between horses, stopped on the second turn and was not urged thereafter. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TANNERS PRIDE dueled inside, inched away in the drive, was under pressure through the stretch and held well under urging. LODE THE GOLD raced
between horses to the turn, was in contention throughout and outfinished in a game effort. BANDWIDTH raced mid pack, closed steadily mid track, gained
late and just lasted for show. TWO THE PUNCH raced in the back, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and was gaining ground. TRUE
VALOR saved ground and improved position in a steady effort. MYSTICAL IMAGE dueled three across to the turn, dropped back and finished evenly.
UNCLE GOYLE raced in the second flight, bid inside to get within range and came up empty late. UNLEASH THE BEAST stalked the pace, was carried out
leaving the turn and gave way. PER RULING #19-20TP130 FROM THE ARIZONA RACING COMMISSION, TANNERS PRIDE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A

Footnotes
KIJANI was never far back, went six wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides. SINK THE BISMARCK
showed good early speed inside, fell back, came again, assumed command late and was outclosed in a good effort. HOLLYWOOD DREAMER was
unhurried early, went eight wide entering the stretch and finished well to get up for show. WED O'S CHAMP stalked the pace, fell back leaving the turn and
finished evenly. SUMMER BUDDHA was slow early, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and closed well to narrow the gap. DELUX PREMIER raced
mid pack in an even effort and did not threaten. WILT challenged for the lead into the turn, dueled for the lead, inched clear and faltered near the sixteenth
pole. TIZ TOUSSAUD got away alertly, was hustled along to duel to mid stretch, weakened and fell back. PAPA JOE was not a factor. MAKERS WAY was
outrun. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was through early and dropped back steadily. RANDY'S BOY was outrun. PER RULING #19-20TP131 FROM THE
ARIZONA RACING COMMISSION, KIJANI WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
AWESOME SLATE settled mid pack, rallied four wide into the turn, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, dueled to late stretch and inched clear to
prove best. THIN LINE dueled two across, drew clear into the turn, responded when challenged to duel to late stretch and yielded grudgingly.
SHACKLEFORD BANKS was void of early speed, saved ground, angled out into the turn, bid five wide and closed to get up for show. HAT IN THE RING
settled off the pace, bid between horses on the turn, closed inside to threaten, didn't have enough late and lost position. FOREVER THE CHIEF failed to
menace in an even effort. THISISMYSTORY was hustled along to contend inside to the second turn, tired and gave way. SILENT PARADISE was not a
factor.

Footnotes
TIGER BY HIS TAIL was boxed in and steadied repeatedly to the second turn, got through along the inside, assumed command and drew clear. TYLER'S
TEK raced mid pack, bid off the rail leaving the turn, couldn't gain on the winner, hung late and held for place. PULPITS POWER dueled inside to the
second turn, swung wide, fell back, continued willingly to the wire and earned show. OUR DANDY'S BOY was slow early, bid along the rail on the turn and
didn't have enough late. PARLAY PONTI trailed the field, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and closed well. SIX CIDER showed speed to the second
turn, swung seven wide and leveled off. HALLIE'S HERO was not a threat. SIX POINT RACK dueled two across to the second turn and gave way.
