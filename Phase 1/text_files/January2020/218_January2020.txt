Footnotes
SHE GIVES ME FITS accelerated to the lead three wide approaching the three eighths pole and was steadily encouraged through the stretch to hold on
well. YOUR EYES TO MINE set the pace the opening three sixteenths then gave chase from the three eighths pole, and, while finishing well, was unable to
gain. GOLDEN CHANCE pressured the pace through most of the backstretch but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and showed little more.
WORKINGONAMIRACLE hesitated at the break then saved ground while giving chase. PAINT ME PRETTY gave chase outside and rounded the turn in the
six path.

caught approaching the top of the lane and weakened. SO RED THE ROSE settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase toward the

Footnotes
SCOTTISH MAN took over three wide midway on the opening turn then angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole,
dueled at the rail rounding the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off MELDON, who stalked the winner off the rail, gave chase from
the three eighths pole, dueled close to the top of the stretch but was turned back through the lane. BUSTED HALO settled off the pace about the three path,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but showed little more. CARTER'S RUN saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, but, flattened out in the three path of the far turn. SILVER TAURUS raced off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened in the five path of the far turn. WINDSOR HILL saved ground racing well off the pace. ROCKAROUND
raced outside leaving the second turn and was not a factor. LITTLE MAXIMOVA raced off the pace in the three and four paths and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SIR LONGWOOD gave chase toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in through the lane to get up later yards. LUCKY NED PEPPER gave
chase through the backstretch and took over from the wide racing pace-setter midway on the turn, dug in from the top of the stretch but was outfinished the
final yards. FIREBIRD gave chase and rounded the turn two deep then finished well at the outside girth of Lucky Ned Pepper. NO ALTAR BOY gave chase
from well back, came through the turn at the rail and passed a rival. A LITTLE BANGED UP set a clear pace toward mid track but bore out and lost the lead
toward the top of the stretch then weakened. GATTOSING chased the pace two deep while between horses then dropped back toward the quarter pole and
weakened on the turn. TALENT QUEST raced well back.
