between horses on the backstretch and outside the pacesetter on the second turn, took a slim lead into the stretch, was between foes in upper stretch and

Footnotes
SLEWBURY PARK had speed three deep to press the early pace then stalked outside a rival, re-bid three wide on the turn and into the stretch, took a short
lead in midstretch, fought back under urging a sixteenth out and gamely prevailed. ON THE VERGE chased off the rail then three deep leaving the turn and
into the stretch, bid three wide past midstretch and continued willingly but could not get by the winner. AWESOME ALESSANDRA had speed between
horses then stalked just off the rail, re-bid between foes on the turn, put a head in front, fought back just off the fence in the stretch and was outfinished late.
POLAR ROUTE stalked inside, split rivals leaving the turn, angled back to the inside in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. EXCESS COIL broke a
bit slowly, settled off the rail, came a bit wide into the stretch and lacked a further response. OUI SAY NO dueled inside then inched away on the
backstretch, battled inside on the turn, fell back a quarter mile out and had little left for the drive.

the leader leaving that turn to gain the advantage into the stretch, inched away under urging in midstretch and held on gamely. SUPER PATRIOT angled in
and settled just off the rail, came out leaving the second turn and three deep into the stretch and edged a rival for the place. LA SARDANE (FR) broke a
step slowly, tugged three deep then stalked just off the rail, went up three wide on the second turn and into the stretch, drifted in some late and was edged
for second. STREAK OF LUCK hopped slightly at the start, angled in and settled inside, came out into the stretch and again in upper stretch and was four
wide on the line. TAKE THESE CHAINS (IRE) stalked inside then between foes on the second turn and through much of the stretch and lacked the needed
late kick. KEEPER OFTHE STARS sped to the early lead, dueled inside then stalked along the rail to the stretch and weakened some in the drive. BRILL

Footnotes
DERBY STORM had good early speed and dueled inside, took a short lead on the second turn, inched away under urging in midstretch and held on gamely.
SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE chased outside a rival then three deep on the second turn and into the stretch and finished willingly. CROSS TOWN had speed
between horses to set a pressured pace, dueled outside the winner leaving the second turn and into the stretch and bested the others. NIL PHET four wide
into the first turn, stalked three deep on that bend then outside a rival on the backstretch, continued a bit off the rail on the second turn and weakened.
SHARED prompted the pace three deep, fell back a bit leaving the second turn, angled in off the rail into the stretch and also weakened. STARSHIP
CHEWY saved ground off the pace, came out a bit in the stretch and did not rally. FORT DODGE broke a bit slowly, angled in and settled inside, came off
the rail on the backstretch, went outside a rival into the stretch and was not a threat. SON OF A QUEEN hopped a bit at the start, stalked between horses
then a bit off the rail, continued inside on the second turn, came out into the stretch and weakened.
