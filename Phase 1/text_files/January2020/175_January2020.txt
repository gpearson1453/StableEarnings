Footnotes
FACTORINO was sent hard at the start and held a slim lead then cleared on top and held firm along the inside around the turn, was put to a drive near the
furlong marker, dug in gamely with ears pinned back and just lasted over gaining UNION COLONEL. UNION COLONEL was forwardly placed up the inside
in opening stages, remained in close contention under some mild prompting around the turn, came under strong left handed pressure upper stretch, drifted
out while gaining on FACTORNO, was getting to the winner in final strides and just missed. THE VIRGINIAN raced off the pace in opening stages and
dropped to the inside to save ground, was patiently handled around the turn, shifted out and hustled along at head of the lane, moved out wider while
positioned behind drifting out UNION COLONEL and continued a steady late effort for show. LONELY PRIVATE hustled up from the get-go and raced in
range early on, moved through the turn three to four wide then got carried wide into stretch and lost ground, switched in a few paths and gained position
late. MR NAPPY moved in from the outside moving through the backstretch, raced off the early pace and saved ground around the turn, hustled along into
stretch run, had a mild improve and finished on equal terms with STRONG ENDING. STRONG ENDING bumped the gate and raced off the early speed,
hustled along the outside around the turn, moved into stretch wide then switched in a few paths, produced a mild bid and finished on equal terms with MR
NAPPY. MUKULWITZ lacked early foot and raced in the back, left the backstretch three wide and urged around the turn, kept under steady pressure and
passed tiring foes in the lane. LASTING IMAGE raced in the last flight, was under a ride four to five wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for late
impact. DR. DOYLE showed response in opening stages then lost position around the turn, chased on two wide upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.
PALACE KID raced in close contention of the early leader, remained in a forward position and chased after the eventual winner into upper stretch then came
up empty in the final furlong. BLOODPROF hustled along and positioned as a strong contender in early stages then flattened out around the turn and
offered no late rally. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF lacked early foot and dropped over to the inside to save ground, was under a ride racing three wide upper
stretch but failed to kick on.

Footnotes
BEAST MODE was sent through on the rail to join the leaders midway up the backstretch, dueled inside EL ZEUS around the turn, briefly lost the advantage
to STEADILY at the top of the stretch, then responded to regain command past the eighth-pole and was going away late under hand urging. STEADILY
moved to contention with a four-wide move past the five-sixteenths, poked a head in front of BEAST MODE from outside turning for home, but proved no
match through the last eighth of a mile while a pole clear of the others. EL ZEUS vied early between horses, battled inside BEAST MODE on the turn, and
gave way approaching the stretch to wind up a distant third. RUSSIAN WINE pressed the early pace three wide, weakened around the turn and dropped far
back. GONE DIESEL felt the whip being sent hard from the gate, held a short and brief lead leaving the chute, but dropped back from between horses after
a half-mile. ALL STAR SEILER stayed in range early in the two-path, but lost ground steadily after six furlongs. MIRIAM'S SKY bobbled slightly at the start,
was taken outside early, and showed nothing.

Footnotes
L' CRISTABAL was forwardly placed out of the chute and remained in striking range of the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid for EXCALIBUR
mid-way around the turn, vied for the lead out of the turn and continued to battle into stretch run, raced heads apart past the furlong marker, dug in under
steady pressure, gained a slim advantage in final stages and edged away. EXCALIBUR led the way out of the chute and set the pace two off the inside
down the backstretch, challenged by L' CRISTABEL mid-way through the turn, continued to battle back for the lead into stretch run, remained determined in
pursuit but failed to have a closing kick left for final stages. ULTRACONFIDENT raced in early contention and tracked the top two leaders, was ridden along
going by the half mile marker and hustled along while after the top pair around the turn, was no match for the pulling away top two finsihers but continued a
steady effort and cleared the rest. CAB BEEF was allowed to settle in early stages not too far off the pace then angled closer to the inside late backstretch,
launched a bid entering the far turn, gained position then raced five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. GALAXY INVASION was off slow at the start
and lagged behind the field out of the chute, remained reserved in the back and saved ground, was under a drive along the rail around the turn and lacked
the needed response for impact. WICKED WEDNESDAY angled to the inside to save ground in early stages and showed interest racing in range of the top
two leaders, failed to sustain bid entering the turn and retreated. DRY LAND stumbled at the start, recovered quickly and showed early interest then had no
response around the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
BEE CATCHER had striking range in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, shifted out four wide at the top of the lane, rallied steadily and wore down the
leaders in the last 70 yards to edge clear at the finish. JUULSTONE raced in the second flight around the far turn three wide, and rallied willingly outside to
get up for second near the wire. COMPLEX SYSTEM held a short lead through the opening half-mile, saved ground into the far turn being hounded by
ALPHA DOG and AFRICAN HERITAGE, edged away again through the furlong grounds, but could not withstand late challenges on the wrong lead.
AFRICAN HERITAGE moved off the inside with a move to contention in the three-path heading up the backstretch, continued to battle outside rivals around
the far turn and into the stretch, and ran on with good courage to the finish. ALPHA DOG was prominent early, vied between horses around the far turn and
into the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. LEADING WEST saved ground close-up for six furlongs, raced behind horses in the stretch
and was stymied in traffic the last sixteenth of a mile. DEGAS raced three wide early, and failed to respond in the two-path turning for home. ROBIN TEAM
SHOW got sawed off at the start between JUULSTONE and YAMAZAKI, and was not a factor. TAPAGE tossed his head around while unsettled on the first
turn behind horses, and was empty when roused approaching the stretch. YAMAZAKI was strung out four wide on the first turn near the back, advanced on
the far outside up the backstretch, but was through before reaching the stretch.

ASSUME CONTROL raced near the inside and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid for the lead entering the turn, advanced to race
in aim of NOTHINS FREE top of the lane, prompted right handed and assumed control near the furlong marker, stayed sharp in response and widened to a
clear advantage. NOTHINS FREE stumbled badly at the start but recovered gamely and led the way out of the chute, raced along the inside and set the
pace down the backstretch, picked up the tempo and remained the leader around the turn, turned for home three wide with the advantage then failed to hold
off the challenge from ASSUME CONTROL near the eighth pole and held late for place. DIZZY raced off the top two leaders in a strung out field through
early stages, was ridden along to pick up the pace midway down the backstretch, remained in steady pursuit around the turn, drifted out wider upper stretch
and raced under right handed pressure upper stretch, then shown the whip and mildly prompted in the final sixteenth and gained on place. DENVER raced
in the back and continued reserved two to three paths wide down the backstretch, remained well off the pace and hustled up around the turn, moved into
stretch run four wide and failed to move into contention. FOREVER MARTA raced well off the top trio and hustled along down the backstretch, remained
under steady pressure along the outside around the turn, failed to gain on the leaders and had no late response.

LIFE ON TOP was unhurried for six furlongs, moved out four wide turning for home, rallied late between horses and was just up. BRIEFCASE BULLY trailed
early inside, swung to the far outside leaving the far turn, and closed steadily to just miss. TURN OF EVENTS bumped with MORE CHANCES at the start,
was in the five-path early on the first turn before moving in a bit, closed in on the leading trio shifting four wide at the top of the lane, fought his way to a
short lead in deep stretch, and narrowly missed inside the top two finishers. OR'EFFICE saved ground for nearly six furlongs, briefly left the fence going
around a spent MAINE, moved back to the rail for the drive, got through inside EAGERLY in mid stretch to loom a threat, but was outkicked under mild hand
urging. THIS ILL DEFEND saved ground to the far turn before moving to the two-path, encountered some traffic through deep stretch and was going well
nearing the wire. EAGERLY pressed the pace from the outset, bid between horses, reached the front through the furlong grounds, and was being
outfinished when clipped from behind by WIN D'ORO in deep stretch. MORE CHANCES bumped with TURN OF EVENTS at the start, tracked the leaders
from outside, took the lead three wide coming to the quarter-pole, but was outkicked from there. WIN D'ORO had the two-path on the turns near the back,
raced in traffic through mid stretch, and bobbled after clipping the heels of EAGERLY late. ALWAYS MISBEHAVING stayed in range for six furlongs two
then three wide, and faded in the lane. MAINE set the early pace inside, got reeled in midway on the far turn, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
BAD LITTLE BEAST was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced six wide down the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the turn and gained the
position off the top pair, remained in steady pursuit for the top two leaders entering top stretch, dug in six wide under left handed pressure, finished
determinedly and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. GRAN CASIQUE was forwardly placed in opening stages and a bit keyed up wanting to go with FAST
LOADED for the early lead, let out a notch and raced on equal terms moving into the turn, continued to battle for the lead past the furlong marker, could not
hold off the bid from the winner in late stages but stayed on with response for place. FAST LOADED quickly cleared on top and crossed over to race a path
off the inside, led the way under pressure from close running GRAN CASIQUE in early stages, challenged and vied for the lead around the turn, continued
to duel and fought back gamely with a furlong left to run, was no match when the winner drew by in the final sixteenth then got edged out late for place.
SILVERLY ENOUGH hustled along in opening stages and chased after the pace through the backstretch, remained in steady pursuit around the turn, raced
along the outside entering top stretch then shifted in a few paths and finished on equal terms with WITH VERVE. WITH VERVE settled in early stages
racing five wide, prompted around the turn then moved five wide into the lane, gained a couple positions and finished on equal terms with SILVERY
ENOUGH. SUN SQUALL showed interest in early stages then weakened and dropped to last around the turn and offered no late rally. ONE TURN
JOHNNY lacked early foot from the gate and dropped over to the inside to save ground, continued off the pace then was under a drive racing two wide
around the turn to no avail. SARASOTA BOY raced along the rail and tracked the top two leaders, roused for more entering the turn, failed to advance
position then dropped back in the final furlong.

STARSHIP JUBILEE quickly took command, rated along through an easy pace in the two-path, moved inside on the far turn, and kicked away through the
stretch under mild hand urging. BEAUTIFUL LOVER went along covered up behind the leaders for six furlongs, shifted out three wide into the lane and
finished willingly for the place while never a threat to the winner. VOW TO RECOVER prompted the pace outside STARSHIP JUBILEE to the stretch, and
was outkicked for second between horses. SWEET HITCH HIKER had a rail trip, and lacked a solid late bid. BIENVILLE STREET raced in the second flight
two then three wide, and failed to become a factor. RAKI bounced off ADMIRAL'S WIN at the start, then bumped lightly with JUST SASSY a stride later,
saved ground and could not keep pace after six furlongs. ADMIRAL'S WIN bumped with RAKI at the start, raced under a firm hold early three wide, and was
empty when roused leaving the far turn. JUST SASSY bumped lightly with RAKI after the start, and showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
MARCH TO THE ARCH broke a step slowly, went along under a firm hold three wide entering the backstretch, moved out to the five-path turning for home,
uncorked a strong kick on the far outside and was up to nail MUGGSAMATIC in the closing strides. MUGGSAMATIC tucked in off the leaders inside, was
guided out three wide getting his cue at the top of the stretch, rallied smartly to take over outside SOUPER SCAT DADDY and MAX K. O. in mid stretch,
pulled clear a sixteenth out but was caught coming to the line. GALLEON MAST settled toward the back for six furlongs, came three wide into the lane,
offered a mild response between horses through the furlong grounds and got up for the show. CURLIN'S HONOR saved ground early, came under a ride in
the two-path approaching the stretch, and was outfinished between horses. SECOND MATE stayed in range three then four wide to the top of the stretch,
and could not gain one-paced to the finish. SOUPER SCAT DADDY prompted the pace outside MAX K. O., turned up the pressure challenging for
command past the quarter-pole, battled on to mid stretch and weakened. SCRAPS was two wide early, advanced a bit along the rail on the far turn, stayed
inside for the drive and lacked the needed final response. MAX K. O. set an easy pace for six furlongs, fought on to the eighth-pole and faded in the
two-path. JAIS'S SOLITUDE trailed inside to the stretch and failed to respond.

NOBLE DRAMA settled out of the gate and continued unhurried in the back through early stages, moved in to save ground midway down the backstretch
switched back out and tapped on the shoulder to pick up the pace entering the far turn, roused four wide and moved up in closer contention near the quarter
pole, moved out wider for the drive, advanced to race in aim for the lead at the furlong marker, kept on determinedly and battled with RED CRESCENT
nearing the wire and got a head up for victory. RED CRESCENT settled nicely and rated off the early leaders while never far off the early pace, steadily
inched up closer on the leader around the turn then was under a drive three wide at head of the lane, vied for the lead with a trio of pursuers at the furlong
marker, continued to battle for the late lead with NOBLE DRAMA, remained game in response and got denied in final stride. SQUEEZADIOS held a slim
lead moving into the first turn then conceded position to SALUTE WITH HONOR, stalked the pace through early stages then hustled up around the turn,
was driving along the inside turning for home, advanced to duel for the lead with a furlong left to run, stayed on with response then lacked a closing kick to
move on. SALUTE WITH HONOR took command moving around the first turn, secured the advantage and set the pace down the backstretch, picked up the
tempo and held off challengers around the turn, challenged by oncoming pursuers upper stretch, dueled for the lead at the eighth pole then was all out in
late stages and gave way. SUPER DUDE was forwardly placed and tracked the pace down the backstretch, launched a bid for command around the turn,
hustled up turning for home, got in tight and steadied nearing the furlong marker then got clear and stayed on with interest. TAP THE MOJO raced in range
while tracking the early pace, launched a bid entering the far turn, stayed on under strong handling in upper stretch then flattened in the drive. JAY'S WAY
was unprepared at the start, came way slowly and spotted the field five lengths, steadied slightly moving into the first turn, showed interest while positioned
not far off the early pace then dropped back, lost contact with the field, was pulled up in stretch then walked off.

Footnotes
BOLD DADDY tracked the pace three wide in the clear for six furlongs, rallied steadily through the lane and wore down the leaders from outside late.
GOSILENTLY pressed the pace outside UNION RICHES from the start, reached a short lead at the eighth-pole, and fought gamely to the finish.
AMERICAN NINJA was bumped between horses at the start, edged closer to the front flight in the two-path after six furlongs, moved inside turning for
home, split horses in traffic a sixteenth out and finished with good courage inside the top two. YEAR OF THE KITTEN raced in the second flight two wide to
the far turn, shifted out to the four-path into the lane, and gained gradually outside the leaders. UNION RICHES broke to the lead, set the pace through an
even clip to the stretch, dug in along the rail through the furlong grounds, but yielded late. MAJESTIC LUNA saved ground on the turns, and failed to make
headway through the drive. MR CHAPLIN bumped with AMERICAN NINJA at the start, saved ground to the far turn before moving to the two-path, and
made no impact. POSTINO'S VOW bumped with AMERICAN NINJA at the start, raced four wide throughout and lacked a response. MISSION DRIVEN
raced three wide and was always outrun. LEAVEEMATTHEGATE saved ground early, had the two-path on the far turn and could not reach contention.
