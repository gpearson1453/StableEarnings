Footnotes
CONQUER bumped with FREDDY SOTO at the start, came through along the rail to join the leaders after a quarter-mile, edged away approaching the
stretch and drew off under a drive. PURECRAZIDUDE ran in the second flight three then four wide for a half-mile, and rallied outside to go clear of the
remainder. CAPITAN FOFO tracked in the clear behind the leading trio around the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a solid late response. CAT
GONE QUICK contested the pace outside CONQUER and MISTER NOISI into the turn, and faded through the drive. IRON DRILL broke slowly and veered
in to the rail after the start, saved ground improving past tired horses approaching the stretch, but had nothing more. WE CONNECTED faded two then
three wide on the turn. MISTER NOISI argued the pace in the two-path, and weakened between rivals late on the turn. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST was outrun
four wide. FREDDY SOTO bumped with CONQUER at the start, and showed little inside. SEE THE SONG was done early while four then five wide.

Footnotes
BUNDI BUNDI broke out at the start and held a slim lead over MAGNOLIA BLVD leaving the chute, cleared on top and led the way down the backstretch
then pulled away to a commanding lead around the turn, was under a drive three wide entering top stretch, stayed under firm handling with rivals closing in,
had just enough in late reserve and held on. CONSILIUM settled and raced off the early pace, was ridden along nearing the half mile marker, continued to
hustle up and gained position along the outside moving through the turn, stayed on with response in pursuit of BUNDO BUNDI, was getting to rival in final
strides and just missed. AT THE BEACH angled to the inside shortly after the start, rated off the second flight then launched a bid along the inside entering
the turn, cut the corner entering stretch, stayed on with response up the inside and cleared the rest. SILENT MISCHIEF was off a step slow at the start then
stayed slow into stride and lagged in the rear, prompted for response around the far turn, moved into stretch run two wide, showed interest and gained
position without threatening. BIP BIP FULL POWER raced off the early pace while positioned four wide midway through the backstretch, hustled up moving
into the turn then dropped inside and urged along the rail, stayed inside for the drive and failed to threaten. PRIZED WARRIOR was reserved and raced off
the pace through early stages, prompted along the outside around the turn, moved into stretch six wide and lacked a needed rally. ANYWHERE ROAD got
carried out wider at the start, stayed outside and raced in range tracking the early pace, roused for more entering the turn but failed to advance position then
dropped back. MAGNOLIA BLVD was forwardly placed and raced just off the leader leaving the chute, stalked the pacesetter through early stages then
launched a bid late backstretch, was under a drive but failed to gain close contention on the leader then came up empty and retreated out of the turn.
MACHO D'ORO veered out and steadied at the start, raced in contention through early stages then came up empty and retreated after the half mile marker.

Footnotes
QUEEN NEKIA went along covered up in the two-path to the end of the backstretch, moved out four wide advancing past the midway point of the far turn,
caught CUDDLE KITTEN into the stretch, dueled outside that rival and proved best on the wrong lead. CUDDLE KITTEN set the pace through an even clip
inside, got collared turning for home and yielded grudgingly. NIKKI BEACH saved ground staying close from the start, was ridden along for a response
around the far turn, but could not gain. BIMINI raced in striking range between horses for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. PERSPIRE raced three wide
on the turns, and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
CAUSALISTIC leaned out and bumped with foe at the start, tracked the top two leaders through early stages, advanced three wide to take a slim lead at the
five sixteenths pole, cleared on top then widened under pressure at the head of the lane, gained a commanding lead then finished wrapped up. DRAW THE
LINE settled inside and saved ground while rated off the early leaders, picked up the pace entering the turn, coaxed between foes at the quarter pole,
moved out wider for the drive, stayed on five wide with response, was no match for the winner but finished clearly second best. AYCAPOTE raced inside of
the eventual winner and tracked the top two leaders through early stages, stayed inside and prompted near the three eighths pole, remained in steady
pursuit near the inside into stretch run and kept along for share. NIMBLE BEAST got bumped at the start then was forwardly positioned coming out of the
chute, applied pace pressure to ROMARIO down the backstretch then launched a two wide bid for command near the three eighths pole, remained in close
pursuit around the turn then failed to sustain bid and faded in the lane. ROMARIO held a slim lead out of the chute then set a pressured pace down the
backstretch, got headed for the lead by the winner midway through the turn, kept under a ride entering top stretch but had nothing left in late reserve and
faded. WAY MORE broke in and bumped with foe at the start, was rated through early stages, failed to respond when called upon in the turn then raced four
wide into upper stretch, shifted out wider under pressure and failed to move on. DRACARYS FIRE got bumped between foes at the start and raced in the
back, continued in the rear down the backstretch, failed to advance into a threatening position around the turn then pulled up after the race and vanned off.
Race was hand timed due to timer malfunction

Footnotes
DERMOT perched just behind the leaders saving ground to the far turn, waited for an opening in the two-path past the quarter-pole, found a seam and
rallied three wide at the top of the stretch, dueled outside BEBEAU into the final furlong and drove clear under good handling. BEBEAU prompted the pace
outside LION CHARMER for six furlongs, reached a short lead between horses at the top of the lane, battled inside DERMOT past the furlong marker and
kept on gamely for the place. NEW YEAR saved ground early, came under a ride four wide into the far turn, remained a factor through upper stretch but
flattened out on the wrong lead. LION CHARMER set the pace inside, dug in when challenged by BEBEAU turning for home, but yielded past the
eighth-pole. HAIL MICHIGAN was never far back, lodged a mild bid three wide between horses around the far turn, but gave way in the lane. THREE DEEP
raced two wide on the turns, and could not reach contention. LONGSHIPS bobbled a couple strides from the gate, steadied lacking room on the rail
approaching the first turn, continued to save ground and made no impact. TRINNI ALEX was slow into stride, raced three wide and was finished before
reaching the stretch.

DROP KICK was ridden along five wide through early stages, loomed up boldly four wide at the quarter pole, raced under firm right handed pressure
entering the lane, advanced to vie for the lead with MR. KISSES in the final furlong, dug in racing in the two path under strong handling and got a head up
late. MR. KISSES checked at the start when rival broke out and lost ground, hustled up and quickly advanced into closer contention, made a move between
foes at the three eighths pole then raced in striking distance for the lead, vied with COLORMEPOMPOM nearing the furlong marker then shook by rival
while taking on the challenge from DROP KICK, battled back gamely from the inside position, rider briefly stopped riding for a few strides at the alternate
finish line then came back under pressure approaching the wire and got denied. PASSIONATE HACHI veered out and tightened things up for a pair of rivals
at the start, was allowed to settle while rated through early stages, picked up the pace entering the turn, split foes past the quarter pole then was set down
six wide for the drive, remained in steady pursuit along the outside in the lane and prevailed for a share. PARTICULARITY was unhurried and raced in the
back, picked up the pace along the outside around the turn, raced wide entering the lane and improved late. COLORMEPOMPOM broke sharp from the
outside position, quickly cleared on top and crossed over to the inside, continued to lead the way by a comfortable margin down the backstretch, dug in for
more and held a slim lead around the turn, vied for the lead with MR. KISSES with a furlong left to run then came up tired nearing the final sixteenth.
RATTLE'M raced inside in contention through early stages, roused for more entering the turn but failed to kick on and gave way. STOLEN IDENTITY got
bumped at the start then chased after the early leader, continued in close range at the three eighths pole then failed to sustain bid shortly after and faded.

Footnotes
SCATNAP drafted along behind the leaders inside, tipped out to the four-path in upper stretch, and kicked in to wear down PUGILIST in the final 50 yards.
PUGILIST prompted the pace three wide for six furlongs, bid for command at the top of the stretch, wrested the lead from SHE'S RIGHT AGAIN entering the
final furlong, but could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN vied outside SHE'S RIGHT AGAIN, challenged between
horses midway on the far turn, battled on through upper stretch, and weakened past the eighth-pole. RETRO STREET settled in midpack through the
opening stages, raced two wide on the far turn and lacked a solid late response. SHE'S RIGHT AGAIN vied for command inside through a moderate pace,
and gave way on the rail in the stretch. DRINKS ON ME raced near the three-path much of the way, and did not become a factor. MONEY FACTOR was
never prominent three wide. FUN PADDY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
DR HARLAN was off slow at the start, was allowed to settle in opening stages, raced in the back then picked up the pace entering the turn, moved into
contention along the rail, cut the corner entering stretch run, remained determined up the inside, dug in under firm pressure and got up late. SWAGGER was
off to a good start and vied for the lead with BLINGS EXPRESS, continued to match strides into the turn then shook clear near the quarter pole, roused for
more in stretch run, stayed game in response then got wore down by DR HARLAN in final stages. GEMOLOGISTER raced in the second flight in early on,
chased after the top pair around the turn, moved into stretch four wide under a drive then moved out wider and kept on with response to take share.
CHARGE CARD raced off the early speed and angled to the rail, switched out and prompted around the turn, raced between foes at the quarter pole and
got carried out wider turning for home, remained in pursuit and seven wide with a furlong left to run then finished evenly. KARMA KING was ridden along
five wide through early stages, roused along the outside around the turn, moved into stretch six wide, gained some ground then evened out. ZALZA hustled
along under steady urging and chased after the early pace, was under left handed pressure turning for home, angled in a couple paths upper stretch and
lacked a needed rally. BLINGS EXPRESS vied for the early lead with SWAGGER, continued to match strides entering the turn, could not move on with rival
at the quarter pole, stayed on upper stretch then tired in the final furlong. PACHANGA PARTY raced wide throughout and failed top move into contention.
KAREN'S COVE chased in the second flight down the backstretch, remained in pursuit into the turn then came up empty near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
DREAM MARIE was allowed to settle early, took closer order heading into the turn, swung four wide advancing to contention after six furlongs, wrested
command into the final furlong and drove clear while drifting out. ADDILYN pressed the pace outside BLOSSOM BOW up the backstretch, dueled in the
two-path between horses around the turn, fought through the lane on the rail, and held well for the place. GLOBAL AMBITION broke outward at the start,
stayed in striking range early, bid three wide between horses midway on the turn, remained in the fight through upper stretch, then weakened in the late
stages. LAVI raced in the second flight near the inside for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and lacked a bid. GOOD TO ME was carried out at the start
by GLOBAL AMBITION, lodged a brief four-wide bid midway on the turn, but gave way before reaching the stretch. BLOSSOM BOW set a pressured early
pace inside, retreated around the turn and was not pressed in the stretch. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
KITTEN BY THE SEA was forwardly placed racing just off the leader entering the first turn, stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch then let out a notch
moving though the turn, took over the lead at head of the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. TRULY settled along the inside and saved
ground racing near midpack, switched out a path and hustled up near the quarter pole then shifted out wider turning for home, remained in pursuit for the
winner, could not reach KITTEN BY THE SEA but produced a solid effort for second best. WEEKEND MADNESS got slammed between foes at the start,
raced in the last flight down the backstretch, hustled up around the turn, stayed on five wide in the lane and gained show. ROONEY backend took a solid
bump at the start, raced in the last flight then steadied nearing the far turn, saved ground entering the stretch run, angled out at head of the lane and gained
position without threatening. ROSASPARKS broke out and bumped foe at the start, stalked inside down the backstretch, continued in close contention
around the turn, switched out a path and hustled up at the head of the lane then failed to move on. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED took the lead after the start
and angled to the inside, set the pace down the backstretch, remained the leader then got headed by eventual winner leaving the final turn and weakened.
ROCKPORT WIND rated off the second flight midway down the backstretch, launched a bid along the outside around the turn, raced in range then fanned
wide into the drive and faded. YASNAI'S LAW got bumped between foes at the start, raced in the back and had no response, lost contact with the field and
was easing up in the lane.
