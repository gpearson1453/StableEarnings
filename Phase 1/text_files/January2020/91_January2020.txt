Footnotes
ANIMATE stalked the early pace three wide then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, pulled himself clear nearing the quarter pole, widened through
the far turn then drew off under mild stretch insistence. NEW BEGINNING raced four wide the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started
a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide then dueled for second the final sixteenth. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT bobbled leaving the
gate then stalked the pace two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then outfinished for second the final sixteenth.
FUERTE saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and passed some fading rivals. ARE U
raced off the pace and off the rail then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, showed little response leaving the far turn. MUSTA NEVER
MET U angled to the rail to set the early pace, was met then gave chase from the three eighths pole, but faded at the rail on the far turn. S S BREW was
never a factor.

GROUP TEXT settled back in the three path then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out at the eighth pole and dug
in to take over later yards. SAINTE THERESE settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole,
raced in the four path of the far turn and took the lead past the eighth pole, drew briefly clear mid-stretch but was caught and gave way later yards. LIKE ME
OR NOT set the pace at even terms with Toto's Darling, came under pressure to put that one away into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn but
ceded the nod past the eighth pole and weakened from mid-stretch. HANALEI SUNSET settled off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced
four wide on the far turn and flattened stride into the lane. RETURN TO DENIS raced well back and could only improve her position. ROCKET THUNDER
settled off the pace toward the inside, started a bid nearing the quarter pole, steadied behind a narrowing opening midway on the far turn and couldn't
recover stride. TOTO'S DARLING matched strides with Like Me Or Not through the opening half mile and challenged that one from the three eighths pole,
but, dropped back nearing the quarter pole and gave way rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
OUR BAD GIRL stalked the pace from the two and three paths then bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead into the far turn, moved clear midway
through the turn and held on well under steady handling. WHIZ PASS settled off the early pace while saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out into the stretch and was along for second later yards. CAROLINA BAMBINA saved ground off the pace then bid
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and was outfinished for second through later yards. CAT CAT'SHORSEPLAY settled
back in the three and four paths then raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and
finished evenly. DAM LOCKS raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path
but proved empty down the lane. VINTAGE GIN angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured toward the three eighths, gave up the lead past the
quarter then weakened into the lane. KATEANDLILLIAN stalked the pace off the rail and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, but, faded from
the mid point of the far turn. LIVE FREE was never a factor.

BACKCAT took quick control of the pace, was only mildly urged leaving the eighth pole and drew off. WITCHY WINDSOR stalked the winner off the rail then
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but had to settle for second best. LIMIT MONEY (DOM) came away a step slow then saved ground through the
opening turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. DEREK'S COP E
CAT hopped from the gate and raced in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole but flattened stride leaving the far turn.
SINGINGINSTILETTOS showed little response through the backstretch. PERFECT PARTY GIRL saved ground into the first turn then eased out entering
the backstretch and proved to be no factor. MISS SIMON steadied into the first turn then settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but
showed little response. VIOLA'S LEGACY was never a factor.

Footnotes
BAYTOWN MILLI contested the pace from the start and prevailed in a long drive. BERNIES ROCKETTE contested the pace from the start but ceded
grudgingly in a game effort. WAKES UP HAPPY gave chase well off the rail, drifted into the lane and was along for third mid-stretch. PURE ROMANCE
chased the pace then dropped back at the rail on the turn and showed little more. DISCREET RUSH gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn then
weakened into the lane. MUNRO raced outside and never factored.
