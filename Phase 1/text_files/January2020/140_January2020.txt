Footnotes
AZKAREE dashed to the front at the start, rated along inside unbothered to the stretch, remained clear past the 70-yard marker while beginning to shorten
stride, and barely lasted. NEWYORK GIANT steadied behind STRENGTH OF GOLD midway up the backstretch, moved off the rail going around that rival
into the turn, advanced to contention approaching the top of the stretch, rallied with good determination and came up just short. TOOK A CAB was driven to
stay close three wide on the turn, had aim outside the top two through the lane but lacked a solid final response. MIGHTY FAST raced in the middle of the
pack near the three-path to the stretch, and could not menace in an even effort. ENANO ASTRAY bumped repeatedly with MOUNTAIN TREE at the start
and was slow to begin despite urging, raced two then three wide on the turn, and improved without threatening. MOUNTAIN TREE bumped several times
with ENANO ASTRAY coming away from the gate, and was no factor inside. ODDS GET EVEN chased outside AZKAREE for three furlongs, and
weakened approaching the stretch. FAST DUDE was always outrun. ANIMA D'OR was finished early four wide. STRENGTH OF GOLD dropped far back
through the turn inside.

Footnotes
ZOE'S DELIGHT was off to a good start then edged back to track the early leaders, remained off the pressured pace although never far back leaving the
backstretch, given cue five wide bid at the quarter pole, moved into stretch six wide and put to a drive, wrested a slim advantage near the furlong marker
then drew clear. PERLMAN raced in tight quarters along the rail and steadied in early stages then sat patiently in range, stayed inside and given cue past
the midway point in the turn, shifted out three wide turning for home, advanced to race in aim for the lead at the furlong marker then failed to kick on with
ZOE'S DELIGHT. SEPTEMBERTEN broke sharp to quickly clear on top and shifted closer to the inside then conceded position to PAYNTED, stayed in aim
and pressed through early stages, hustled along three wide at the quarter pole then sustained a five to six wide run in the stretch run to prevail for a share.
PRINCELY GOD stumbled at the start and came away last, raced six wide and hustled up from the get-go, quickly advanced and headed PAYNTED for the
lead near the seven sixteenths pole, held a clear advantage at the quarter pole then came up tired in the final furlong. MAGICAL MIKE raced in the back
through early stages, hustled along racing two wide entering top stretch and gained some ground but failed to sustain bid and flattened in late stages.
PAYNTED moved up the inside and took the lead just after the start, held a narrow lead under pressure then got headed by PRINCELY GOD entering the
turn, continued to chase after the leaders and dueled for a share with a furlong left to run then lacked late kick. ANNUALIZED was forwardly placed in
opening stages and chased into the turn then came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
DESCENTE was forwardly placed early between horses, took over outside DUDE'S SECRET early on the turn, widened the advantage shaking away from
KEILANI at the top of the stretch, and continued to draw away inside under a mild drive. PAYNTER FEST got shuffled back on the rail heading into the turn,
swung four wide nearing the stretch and rallied to best the others. ODD GAL was put to a drive four wide outside the five-sixteenths, and lacked the needed
response while able to salvage the show. KEILANI pursued DESCENTE from outside around the turn, got shaken off into the lane and weakened. DUDE'S
SECRET felt the whip getting sent to the early lead, and gave way once displaced for command after a half-mile. KAUFY FUTURES raced three wide and
was finished before reaching the stretch. DILLON'S KITTY broke slowly, trailed throughout and dropped far back. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
FENTYNOLA hustled up out of the gate and raced near the lead in opening stages, raced in tight quarters and made contact with MR IMPRESSIVE then
bumped into the rail and steadied slightly entering the turn, angled out and headed in pursuit of the top pair turning for home, was set down top stretch
under firm pressure, kicked in determinedly and surged by PUTMAN in late stages. PUTMAN gained a slim advantage in opening stages then maintained a
narrow lead over LUNAG RI around the turn, shook clear entering top stretch, widened to a clear advantage then got outkicked when FENTYNOLA drew by
in late stages. TEMPESTA raced off the pressured top flight early on then hustled up along the outside around the turn, was set down driving five to six wide
upper stretch and continued a steady effort for secure show. LAST JET OUT raced off the early pace and dropped over to the inside leaving the
backstretch, gained ground along the rail around the turn, cut the corner and kept along the inside under pressure and improved position. ALITE moved off
the inside in opening stages and raced off the early speed, moved into stretch run five wide under pressure and passed a couple of tiring foes. DANZO
hesitated at the break, came away slow and lost ground, raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide and put to a drive upper stretch
but lacked a needed rally. LUNAG RI moved closer to the inside from the outside position at the start, vied for the lead racing a path outside of PUTMAN
around the turn, could not match strides with rival entering top stretch and faded. MR IMPRESSIVE raced up close two wide between rivals then things got
tight entering the turn, made contact with FENTYNOLA and steadied near the three eighths pole, lost kick and steadily faded. MENELIK hustled along out of
the gate and raced in range then weakened while starting to get out around the turn, bolted entering upper stretch, was under right handed pressure in
stretch run, moved in few paths and failed to be a late factor.

lacked a closing kick and got edged out late for share. VISIONS OF YOU bumped the gate then steadied slightly and came away slow, lacked early foot and
moved into the lane four wide, gained ground, shifted out wider then evened out late. SLICK STAR raced in close contention while patiently handled along
the inside in early stages, launched a bid along the rail at head of the lane, continued in contention, switched out a path then gave way in the final furlong.
AWESOME STACK raced in range and chased between foes in early stages, continued a steady bid around the turn then hustled along six wide entering

Footnotes
PREMIER STAR took control right away, rated along two to three wide to the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper stretch, and remained under pressure
to 70 yards out before coasting in. AMERICANUS chased after the winner throughout toward the inside, and clearly bested the others. PERUVIAN BOY
raced three to four wide on the turn, made no headway in the stretch but held the show. SMALL REASON was no factor inside. CALIBRATOR chased the
pacesetter between horses around the turn, and faded steadily in the stretch. OUR TIME was finished early two wide.

Footnotes
XY SPEED was forwardly placed out of the gate and switched in a few paths while racing in striking range of CAPTIAN RON, launched a bid for command
turning for home, dug in under right handed pressure near the furlong marker, shook clear from CAPTAIN RON and held firm. THE CRITICAL WAY raced in
close contention positioned along the rail in opening stages, stayed inside and tracked the top pair around the turn then shifted out three wide turning for
home, was shaken up for the drive, kept along in pursuit with steady response and got up late to finish on equal terms for place with CAPTAIN RON.
CAPTAIN RON set a pressured pace with XY SPEED looming in striking distance through early stages, continued to hold a slight edge over rival around the
turn, fought back gamely for the lead with a furlong left to run, could not move on with XY JET past the furlong marker, gave way and landed on equal terms
for place. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE raced off the early speed and moved inside late backstretch, picked up the pace along the inside then raced in traffic late
turn, hustled up five wide upper stretch and steadily inched up closer to the wire. GRAN SAMAN raced in range under slight restraint moving into the turn,
remained patiently handled tracking in close contention, moved out wider and shaken up for the drive, was coaxed along the far outside upper stretch then
flattened out. FULLY LOADED was away in good order and positioned not far off the early leaders, hustled along three to four wide around the turn then
failed to move on in the lane. OAK BLUFFS came away last and shifted to the outside position in opening stages, urged around the turn then moved into
stretch three wide under a drive and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
LADY KATE pressed the pace three wide, took over after six furlongs, drew clear while drifting out a bit through upper stretch and was kept to pressure.
GORGEOUS IN RAGS raced two then three wide around the turn, could not threaten the winner on the far outside through the lane, and held for a share of
second. CANTEEN was four then three wide around the turn struggling to stay close, lacked a solid bid while moving inside past the eighth-pole, but did
enough to finish on even terms for the place. VIOLENT TRICK broke through the gate unseating the rider prior to the start, reloaded and came away without
incident, vied for command in the two-path early, continued pressing the pace between horses up the backstretch, and gave way around the turn. YES
FACTOR chased off the leading trio inside to the turn, and began to weaken past the three-eighths. FLASHING DIAMOND vied inside early before gaining
control, got collared approaching the quarter-pole and gave way. MYSTIC NILE was never prominent. ROSYJERSEY was outrun throughout. YGRITTE
made no impact, and was eased up late.

Footnotes
AVENIDA MANANA secured inside position around the first turn then tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, stayed inside patiently in a forward
position around the final turn, was shaken up for the drive, advanced up the inside and took the late lead, kept on gamely under firm handling and held on.
ISADORABLE AIDA rated near midpack through early stages, was patiently handled and switched out a couple paths moving around the far turn, moved
out wide into the lane, responded under a drive, was gaining on late leader and just missed. FAITH N HOPE cleared on top and angled inside in opening
stages, set the pace down the backstretch, held off challenger's around the final turn, battled back for the lead with a furlong left to run, could not move on
with AVENIDA MANANA in late stages but stayed game to edge foe for share. MUCH ABOUT IT settled nicely in a forward position and stalked the leader
down the backstretch, raced in striking range for the lead then given cue near the quarter pole, vied for the lead at the furlong marker then yielded and got
edged for show. SPICY NELLY settled in early stages and raced three wide down the backstretch, roused three wide into upper stretch, moved into
contention stretch then stayed on with response under right handed pressure and raced evenly late. BAHAMA KITTEN raced near midrange down the
backstretch, picked up the pace around the final turn, raced wide under left handed pressure upper stretch, stayed on with interest racing widest but needed
more for late impact. VINYARDNINA was unhurried and raced in the back, continued in the rear around the far turn then showed response under pressure
upper stretch, shifted to race five to six wide late and improved but was no enough for late impact. HOTTY TODDY raced off the pace and saved ground
down the backstretch, continued near the inside into stretch run, showed interest under pressure, moved out a path then made contact with SWEET STORY
and steadied late. SWEET STORY settled off the early pace and saved ground, hustled up for response near the three eighths pole, continued a bid up the
inside in stretch run, showed interest then flattened out and bumped with rival deep stretch. CAPE MIST was unhurried down the backstretch, hustled up
near the quarter pole, raced six wide under pressure entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. WATCHIN THE WHEELS raced in range down the
backstretch, stayed in contention three to four wide bid around the final turn then gave way in the lane. BEACH DREAMING raced four wide in the first turn
then rated off the early pace, was under a ride along the outside around the far turn, came out wider for the drive and failed to move on.
