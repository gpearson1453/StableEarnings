Footnotes
FAMILY TRIPS chased the leader from off the rail, angled in on the turn, gained ground into the lane, rallied up the inside and kicked clear to win going
away. LINDA AND MINDA sped to the front, set the pace and angled over to the inside, traveled two wide into the lane, started to weakened late, overtaken
by the winner and held the place. GODDESS APHRODITE chased three wide into the turn, exited two wide and showed a mild response when called upon.
JADE LUCKY SEVEN outside a rival up the backstretch, raced two wide then moved over to the inside and lacked a rally. KATHIA unhurried in the opening
stages, raced wide up the backstretch, six wide nearing the turn, angled in to travel three wide around the bend and weakened. LALA FLEUR along the
inside early, angled out on the turn and came up empty in the final furlong. SEATTLE'S CODE raced outside a rival, off the rail into the turn, angled out and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MINIMAL MISTAKE set the pace with pressure from LOVE AND HOLD to the outside, cleared that rival on the turn and drew off to the stretch, held a
comfortable lead through the lane and was ridden out to the wire. CREDANCE stalked off the rail, left the turn two wide, never threatened the winner but
finished a clear second. EL REGALO F G broke out and bumped foe leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn, angled out in the upper stretch and
earned the show. BLACK FRIDAY bumped at the start, off the rail to the turn, angled in and saved ground to the lane and proved no menace. LOVE AND
HOLD away quickly from gate, pressed the issue from the outside, lugged out around the turn and weakened.
