Footnotes
FORGOTTEN COAST unhurried in the early going, racing near the back, moved up between rivals around the final turn, rallied down the lane and wore
down KRAFTY BOY for the win. KRAFTY BOY raced within striking distance in the early part, moved up four wide down the backside, drove clear at the
head of the final stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner late. FUSAICHI FLAME lacked early speed, was moving up entering the second turn, had to steady,
getting blocked, angled out and gained ground down the stretch. FAMILIAR RHYTHM raced near the middle of the field, moved up outside around the
second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. HATTIES JEWEL broke in, steadied, pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened.
CARBONATED raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. QUALITY PRODUCTION dueled on the front end and weakened. DONWELL
had a tight start, raced in the back and showed little. SHEER MAYHEM pressed the early pace and was finished early. INDIUM vied for the early advantage,
saved ground and stopped.

TEN SILVER PINS pressed the early pace, moved up on the rail entering the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. COWBOY CITY raced within
striking distance, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. BROKE IN A FLASH was an early factor, forwardly placed
throughout and was outfinished for second. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN unhurried, racing near the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
FORZE MAU (VEN) lacked early speed, showed late interest, while finishing wide. HOT TEN raced within striking distance, weakened and was no threat

FREDDIESLILWILDCAT stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the inside, pulled away and proved much the best. KOWBOY'S BOBO went to
the front, dueled down the backside with HOLD ME KAT, left him behind, but couldn't keep up the winner. DREWTEMPO raced in the middle of the pack,
made a mild bid, was no match for the top two, but got by HOLD ME KAT for the show. HOLD ME KAT challenged for the early advantage, weakened and
was outfinished for third. NOMOREQUESTIONS raced within contention, weakened and finished evenly. PRIVATE REALITY always raced near the back
and showed little. CLASSY TONI void of early speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
BOLD LEGEND raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the second turn, waited, lacked running room, angled out, rallied and drove
clear before the wire. VAGARY pressed the pace, took command, drove clear, couldn't match strides with BOLD LEGEND, but was best of others. BIG RED
ROSE got off to a slow start, trailing the field, made a steady gain and got up for the show position. KATIE'S BAYOU went to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and weakened down the home stretch. PODCAST raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. SHE'S SO BOSSY challenged for the
early lead and was finished early. OUR ANABELLE raced near the back, came around the first turn five wide and was never a factor. FLASH N GO always
raced near the back and was never a threat.

RUN RHEA RUN unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out entering the stretch and was going away at the
end. GRANFATHERSLEUGIRL sprinted to the front, pulled away, was collared leaving the second turn, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a
clear second. JOY'S RALLY FINALE lacked early speed, made a steady gain, was no match for the top two, but got up for third. SARAH ANN'S POINTE
broke out at the start, racing in the back, came around the final turn seven wide and made a late gain, racing wide. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER pressed the
early pace, forwardly placed until late, faded down the home stretch. RUBY RED SLIPPERS raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and hung.
