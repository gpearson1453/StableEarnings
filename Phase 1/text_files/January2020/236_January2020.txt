Footnotes
DAYS OF SPRING received a solid bump from DEBBIES UTUBE DIVA at the start, advanced four wide after a half-mile, ranged up to poke a head in front
of LA FLAMENCA nearing the quarter-pole, dueled outside that rival to deep stretch and edged away all out. LA FLAMENCA set a pressured pace along the
inside, fought back when challenged by DAYS OF SPRING turning for home, and yielded grudgingly while clearly second best. BUST OUT LADY saved
ground into the turn within striking range, moved out for the drive and did enough to get the show without menacing the top two. ZANGARVA pressed the
pace outside LA FLAMENCA, weakened between that one and DAYS OF SPRING after six furlongs, then ran on well enough to hold a minor share.
ANGEL'S RUN broke out bumping DEBBIES UTUBE DIVA and was slow into stride, and improved past tired horses while no threat. DEBBIES UTUBE
DIVA got sandwiched at the start between horses, raced well back to the stretch and passed tired foes outside. MISS MY MACHO broke out at the start,
prompted the pace with aim outside the early leaders, but faltered before reaching the stretch. FURY SONG broke outward at the start, and was finished
early in the two-path. HERCULINA was through early inside. TIME SHIFT dropped well out of it four wide on the turn.

Footnotes
TWEET AWAY ROBIN moved up the inside and took over the lead from HONEST GAL in opening stages, set the uncontested pace along the inside down
the backstretch, widened advantage around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, came under right handed pressure near the furlong marker, drew off
from the field and finished ridden out. HONEST GAL broke on top then conceded position to TWEET AWAY ROBIN, remained forwardly positioned and
tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid for command around the turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on under steady
encouragement for place. AWESOMENEWYEAR was a step slow into stride at the start then moved to the inside to save ground, raced in the last flight
through early stages then headed in pursuit around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and raced along for show. MILKAH raced in the last flight
positioned outside of AWESOMEANDNEWYEAR while in range of the early leaders, stumbled over fallen foe nearing the seven sixteenths pole and lost the
rider, was corralled by outrider shortly after and walked off after the race. STRONG PERFORMANCE was positioned as a sharp factor in early stages then
fell while in distress nearing the seven sixteenths pole and euthanized.

HEIRESSINDY got bumped by PRETTY AND FAST and pushed out into FULL STRIDE at the start, moved up around the turn four wide to join the leaders,
took over outside PRETTY AND FAST with a furlong remaining, then was all out to stave off SWEDEN at the finish. SWEDEN prompted the pace three
wide, idled a bit approaching the stretch, rallied late in the two-path and just missed inside the winner. PRETTY AND FAST was pushed out into
HEIRESSINDY at the start, vied outside TYNAN for six furlongs, reached a short lead dueling inside HEIRESSINDY through upper stretch, moved to the rail
passing the eighth-pole and weakened. INDEPENDENT MISS stayed in range two to three wide early, lost position around the turn, then gained belatedly
outside rivals. OUR FANTASY hit the left side of the gate at the start, raced close-up for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late bid. TYNAN set a
pressured pace inside for six furlongs, and was in the process of giving way when checked on the rail behind PRETTY AND FAST at the furlong marker.
FULL STRIDE was bumped by the eventual winner at the start and pushed out considerably, and was outrun three wide. TAPPED TWICE was finished
early inside. AN OBJECTION AGAINST PRETTY AND FAST BY THE RIDER OF TYNAN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
PEACE CONTROL tracked four to five wide through early stages, picked up the pace and loomed up three wide near the quarter pole, assumed command
entering top stretch, cleared on top then shifted out wider and held safe under a driving finish. TONG SHU raced off the early speed, hustled up for
response midway around the turn, raced wide into stretch run, advanced to race in striking distance deep stretch but could not get by the winner. SPEED
TOO TUME was ridden along through early stages then moved up closer near the quarter pole, shifted out wider for the drive and stayed on with response.
BLUE CHICORY hustled along in steady pursuit of the top pair in the backstretch, kept along in range then flattened out mid-stretch. LADY VALENTINA
was forwardly positioned and pressed the pace in opening stages, vied for the lead racing outside of SOUTHERN TODDY around the turn then weakened in
the lane. OLIVIA'S DREAM raced in the back and angled to the inside, hustled up along the inside around the turn but failed to move on. SOUTHERN
TODDY held a slim lead in opening stages, vied on the inside of LADY VALENTINA around the turn then tired in the drive. GRAN DIAMOND stumbled at
the start and raced off the early pace then wide into stretch and failed to factor.

Footnotes
DECKOLOGY stayed in touch from the outset inside, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch, and rallied steadily to overtake R MAN JOE from outside
in the closing strides. R MAN JOE set a pressured pace outside SASSY BUT SMART, edged clear through the furlong grounds but was worn down late.
SASSY BUT SMART pressed the pace inside R MAN JOE, and weakened past the eighth-pole on the rail. SHAW was slow into stride and trailed four wide
into the turn, moved inward through upper stretch and showed some late interest. GRANNY BRADLEY came under a ride while moving in from the
three-path around the turn, and lacked a solid response. FUTURE PRINCE was outrun inside. WEATHERFORD was forwardly placed three to four wide
into the turn, and faded through the drive. COURAGE DE LION was finished early.

MONFORTE held a slim lead at the start then vied for the lead with ALLGORILLA, shook free from rival at the half mile marker, dictated the pace by a clear

prompted to pick up the pace late backstretch, hustled along under steady pressure around the turn, remained game in pursuit two wide through the lane
but could not reach the winner. ALLGORILLA vied for the early lead racing inside of MONFORTE, could not remain in touch with rival at the half mile marker

stretch and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. VICKY APPLE hopped slightly at the start to get away last, lagged well back to the stretch and
rallied mildly between horses for the last major share. WORTH AVENUE turned in an even effort in the second flight throughout. MARY LEE AND ME
tracked the leaders outside, lodged a mild three-wide bid near the quarter-pole, but faded through the lane. FINAL FLURRY was outrun inside.

MIN IT TO WIN IT held a slim lead out of the gate then dueled for the lead racing inside a pair of pursuers, shook free from REITERATE near the quarter
pole and widened to a clear advantage on top, kept near the inside under steady pressure and held on over late gaining GLORY DIA. GLORY DIA was
allowed to settle out of the gate and continued in back near the inside, hustled up two wide turning for home, rallied in stretch run and was getting to MIN IT
TO WIN IT in final strides. REITERATE got bumped between rivals at the start then came out and made contact with NORMA'S LOVE not long after the
start, vied for the lead with MIN IT TO WIN IT into the turn, failed to match strides with the winner at the quarter pole but stayed on three to four wide in the
lane and secured share. NORMA'S LOVE got bumped at the start then got bumped by REITERATE shortly after, steadied and dropped back, raced off the
clear top trio around the turn, moved into upper stretch five to six wide and failed to move on. MS HEADLEY broke in and bumped with rival at the start, vied
three deep for the early lead, remained forwardly placed and chased the top pair around the turn then gave way in the lane. MRS. MAISEL hustled along on
the inside through the turn, switched out a couple paths upper stretch and had no late response.

Footnotes
LEMNISCATE took command early inside, rated along unbothered and increased the advantage around the turn, was roused through upper stretch and
faced no dangers on the wrong lead. FIRST AND THREE advanced steadily along the rail through the turn, and could not menace the winner while clearly
best of the others. CHARLIE THE GREEK moved up between horses in the three-path on the turn, and ran on for the show. J S BACH chased after the
leader in the three-path for a half-mile, and dropped back late on the turn between horses. JACK B WINKLE was stacked five wide around the turn, and
gave way after six furlongs. STARSHIP ARAMIS hit the right side of the gate lightly at the break, stayed close for a half-mile, and retreated four wide past
the three-eighths. RODDICK chased three to four wide, weakened after a half and dropped far back.

Footnotes
ALIZEE saved ground and raced in a forward position around the first turn then edged back slightly to rate off the early leaders, settled not far off the early
pace, lodged a bid along the rail to challenge BIG TINA for the lead entering the far turn, dueled with rival in stretch run then edged away under a driving
finish. BIG TINA held a slim lead entering the first turn then conceded position to INDICIA entering the backstretch, dueled for the lead then shook free near
the half mile marker, held a brief lead then challenged by ALIZEE entering the far turn, dueled outside of rival under steady pressure in the lane, battled
back gamely but could not match with the winner in final stages. FUN FINDER raced four wide entering the first turn, settled along the outside not too far off
the early pace, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch and advanced briefly then flattened out midway around the turn, was no match for the clear top
pair but stayed on with interest to take show. INDICIA advanced leaving the first turn and led the way into the backstretch then dueled for the lead with BIG
TINA, could not match strides past the half mile marker then weakened around the far turn. GOLDEN TAP stalked the top two leaders through early stages,
raced in aim at the half mile marker then failed to sustain bid and faltered.
