Footnotes
MY GIRL ANNIE tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, steadily advanced to terms with the pacesetter in tandem with a rival leaving
the midway point to advance three, then four wide into upper stretch, wrested the advantage entering the lane and went clear under firm right handed
encouragement. MAST COVE, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, tracked just off the pacesetter into the turn, advanced to press the
issue between foes just inside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but proved no match while best of the others. CAN'TCATCHTHERAXX, off a
step slowly, settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some
position. MOONLIT SEA tracked off the second flight in early stages, split foes gaining position racing through the turn, bid for command inside the leaders
nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the closing stages. MZ. FOO DO, urged to the lead outside foes, angled inwards once gaining a clear advantage
to dictate the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, briefly resisted when challenged but gave way in the stretch and was gathered up late. THREE
ILLUSIONS, shifted to the rail in early stages to track just off the pacesetter but emptied out early.

Footnotes
PUBLICIST broke readily to join the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn, moved away to a narrow advantage dictating the pace just off the rail racing
into the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin through the far turn and responded to firm right handed pressure through the closing stages to
extend the advantage. ALEXBABE tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the first turn, angled to the inside entering the backstretch, came
through inside foes while being roused to advance racing into upper stretch, couldn't gain terms with the winner but edged a rival for the place honors.
SCARLET BOW, off last, angled to the rail early while advancing inside foes to prompt the pacesetter through the backstretch, switched outside that rival
midway through the far turn and continued with interest while losing the place honors late. QUEEN ROLLER, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the
first turn, switched outside the pacesetter racing through the first turn to track just off that foe, was urged to prompt the issue three deep after a half but
faded on the far turn. LAPULGA settled along the inside early and never gained contention. FIRST HOOSIER shifted outside foes early tracking the leaders
as part of the second flight but retreated early.

Footnotes
SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset racing just off the rail, dueled for command through the turn and, edged
forward in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure. ORNERY ANGEL, restless loading in the gate prior to the start, was urged to terms with the
eventual winner forcing the pace outside that foe into the turn but weakened in the closing stages. DARESCA tracked off the second flight in the opening
quarter, split rivals on the turn while being prompted to advance, angled inside the leaders racing into the stretch and finished evenly late. OHIO STORM,
forwardly placed three deep in the opening sixteenth, dropped off the first flight to track the leaders between foes into the turn, angled to the inside midway
through the bend and steadily faded while edging a rival for some position in the closing stages. SHARON'S LAW tracked off the first flight outside foes in
the opening stages, advanced three wide racing into the turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly in upper stretch. LADY
MARCHELLA, off last, never seriously menaced. BLAZING RUBY, reluctant to load prior to the start, broke a step slowly, was prompted to gain a position
just off the leaders inside rivals while shifting a bit off the rail, tracked those foes into the turn and retreated early.

PERFETTO, prominent between rivals from the outset pressing the pace, was eased back off the leaders racing into the turn while shifting outside foes,
raced four wide into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to regain the advantage in time under right handed pressure. MR JOSHUA, bumped
at the start losing some position at the break, was urged to terms with the first flight between foes prompting the pace into the turn, gained a narrow
advantage dueling for command through the turn a bit off rail despite the loss of his rider's whip racing into upper stretch, was roused with his rider's goggles
through the stretch and held a rival for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. MEILLEUR, held up last while shifting off the inside in the
opening stages, was urged to split rivals just off the inside racing into the turn advancing on the leaders, shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch to bid
inside the pacesetter but was outkicked by the top pair. REEDER, forwardly placed four wide, then three wide prompting the pace into the turn, weakened
between foes late. THE GREAT LOUDINI ducked out at the start, was collected to track off the first flight five wide, then three wide into the turn, shifted five
wide in the stretch and continued evenly. POLYGRAM broke inwards bumnping MR. JOSHUA, was collected off that rival to track off the first flight between
foes to the turn but faded early. CONFIRMED was urged to a forward placing nearest the inside but dropped out early.

Footnotes
THE DOER, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted off the rail dictating the pace on a comfortable margin through the backstretch,
held sway into upper stretch and widened on the field through the stretch under firm hand urging. BATTLE CREEK, momentarily reluctant to load, tracked
the pacesetter three deep in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to gain striking distance in that path racing into the far turn, but proved no match
in the drive while clearly best of the others. ARES WARRIOR, reserved in early stages, tracked of the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was
prompted to gain some position between foes racing into the far turn, shifted nearer to the inside entering the lane but had no closing bid. STARS IN THE
PARK angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half and steadily faded nearing the stretch. AUTOGRAPH, forwardly placed
between foes tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, emptied out racing into the far turn. MIGHTY PETE settled inside foes off the second flight
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. ROCKY JOHN was soon outrun.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE AURA broke sharply, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin outside foes in the opening stages, extended the advantage racing into
the turn remaining well off the rail, held sway into upper stretch and was kept to firm left handed pressure. CANDY FOR ALL tracked the pacesetter three
deep between foes into the turn, was urged to advance on the leader nearing upper stretch, drifted out racing past the quarter mile marker but continued
with interest while always only second best. ELUSIVE RYDER broke inwards bumping LIL SALTY, was righted to track the leader four wide as part of the
second flight racing to the turn, altered course inside a drifting rival to race three wide between foes into the stretch but continued with interest to prevail for
a share. VUYELWA broke outwards bumping ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE at the start, was settled into stride, gained some position between foes racing into
the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and continued to improve position. I AM A. LURING, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter into the turn, faded into upper stretch. LIL SALTY, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the turn and lacked a rally.
ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE, bumped at the start, was settled between foes and failed to menace. WINDY COUNTY proved no factor. BAYOU'S LEGACY,
urged to a forward placing inside foes racing through the backstretch, gave way early.

Footnotes
SWEET BLOSSOM was rated off the second flight a bit off the inside to the backstretch, advanced on the far turn to split rivals just off the inside when
presented an opening nearing upper stretch, bid for command just inside BIZNESS BEAUTY in the lane and edged forward late under firm left handed
pressure. The latter reserved outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, gained
position in that path to loom outside the eventual winner in upper stretch but was outkicked. MS. AMETHYST settled last while shifting well off the inside
racing to the backstretch, continued widest through the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. PAINTED IMAGE
tracked the leaders along the inside in the opening half, was eased back from that position nearing the far turn, angled out five wide nearing upper stretch
and continued with a second effort to gain some position late. CLASSY LYNN tracked off the second flight while shifting out three wide on the backstretch,
was prompted to advance in that path between foes racing through the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. DUTCHESS
CAROLINE, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, faded between rivals into the lane. DOMESTIC VIOLET
angled inwards to gain a forward placing between foes, tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the far turn and gave way into the stretch. FLAN
sped clear along the inside to the backstretch, set the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, then gave out abruptly racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
OLLIVANDER broke sharply, sprinted to a clear advantage while angling inwards a bit racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
second bend, was roused to turn back a rival's challenge while shifting out nearing upper stretch and gamely maintained the advantage to the end under
firm right handed pressure. MALIO'S, came through tight quarters racing to the first turn to track off the second flight between foes into the backstretch,
angled to the rail racing into upper stretch and continued willingly inside the leader to close the gap nearing the wire. OSVALDO tracked off the first flight
three wide in the opening half, then continued willingly between foes in that path to the end to prevail for a share. DAS DA ONE, urged to gain a forward
placing racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, prompted that rival into the far turn, was floated wide into the stretch and weakened late. MAN
UPSTAIRS exchanged bumps with WHITECAP BAY, then was steadied off that rival in the opening stages dropping well off the leaders, was prompted to
advance between foes on the far turn, shifted five wide entering the lane and continued to gain some position. HIGH ROLLING DUDE tracked the
pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, then faded into upper stretch. SECRET LIFE STYLE, caught in tight quarters,
then forced to steady off rival racing into the first turn, was caught five wide racing into the far turn and had no rally. JOHNNY ACTION, caught wide avoiding
some traffic racing into the first turn, never gained contention. WHITECAP BAY exchanged bumps with MAN UPSTAIRS in the opening stages, was righted
to track off the second flight between foes to the backstretch but soon came up empty. EPIC JUNIOR settled along the inside racing to the first turn and
soon trailed.

Footnotes
MAD GRACE broke readily to gain a forward placing stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced to prompt that foe on the far
turn, took over racing into upper stretch and moved clear when given her cue under some right handed pressure. CHOLLA switched out a bit tracking just
off the leaders between foes into the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the lane while being urged to advance, couldn't gain terms with the winner but
edged a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. LADY BREXIT sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a
narrow margin just off the rail racing to the far turn, then weakened once headed by the winner racing into the stretch. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY broke in the
air, then was settled last racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. ANIMAUXSELLE
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. GLOVANNA switched outside foes racing to the first
tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but faded early.
