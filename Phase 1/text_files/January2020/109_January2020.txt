BOLD advanced on the backside continuing on to put a head in front on the far turn, digging in down the lane couldn't hold to wide pressure. TYPOTHETAE

Footnotes
THANKS AGAIN a step slow through the turn lost ground to upper stretch surging seven wide getting up on the wire. EYES FORWARD pressed the pace
dueling from the rail down the lane taking a late lead missing on the wire. CHIEF RED BULL went evenly firing five wide in upper stretch angling in dueling
gamely to the wire. DANTU chased the pace swinging out in mid stretch bidding willingly to wire. NOBLE BEHAVIOR chased the pace checking when in a
bit close at the head of the lane finishing evenly. STORM OF THE NILE played no factor. GRAN TOGOSHI was never involved. HEATHWOOD played no
factor. GIANT'S WILLOW pressed on lead through the turn would wilt in upper stretch. GARDEN QUALITY was always outrun. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB
outrun early would tire. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF NOBLE BEHAVIOR AGAINST THE RIDER OF CHIEF RED BULL FOR INTERFERENCE
AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
