Footnotes
BACK SEAT THRILLS tracked the leaders from the inside, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. CHERRY WAY set a pressured pace while
racing three-wide, drifted out in mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner but finished well to hold the place. PERSONAL GUARANTEE pressed
the pace of CHERRY WAY while racing four-wide, checked when that rival drifted out in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. SILENT ZENON settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, checked slightly with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. TETON lacked early foot, raced six-wide
through the turn and finished with some late run. MEGA SOURCE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the
drive. E BAR GOLD pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. DIVE BAR raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and failed to rally. NATIVE EVENT lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. TRUST SANTIAGO settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. QUIEN ES was void of early speed raced three-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid. MR MOO lagged throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE STEADYING OF PERSONAL GUARANTEE
AND SILENT ZENON IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.
