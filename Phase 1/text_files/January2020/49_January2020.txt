Footnotes
R BOY EVENS vied early outside FRIED PLANTAINE, cleared off around the turn, entered the stretch three or four wide spurting farther away under mild
pressure, had the rider drop the whip outside the sixteenth-pole, but it hardly mattered with the issue already decided. NOTHIN BUT NET had the three-path
under urging into the lane, was no threat to the winner but ran on best of the others. FRIENDLY FELLA was outsprinted to the stretch inside, and improved
past tired horses for a share. PINK LEMONADE bumped with CHARLIE ONE at the start, raced three to four wide, and could not reach contention. SACCO
AND VANZETTI bumped with CHARLIE ONE and steadied back between rivals at the start, and was never close three wide. CHARLIE ONE was bumped
between horses at the start, and outrun in the two-path. BARBIE'S KING lacked speed trailing to the stretch, and showed little. FRIED PLANTAINE vied
early inside R BOY EVANS, and stayed on the chase to upper stretch before retreating. COLMAN JOSEPH (IRE) had the leaders in view three then two
wide on the turn, but had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
COMPANY STORE was off to a good start and vied for the lead racing inside of BROTHER AARON, shook free past the half mile marker and widened to
clear advantage still racing in hand around the turn, prompted for more upper stretch then raced under firm left handed pressure in late stages and had
enough in reserve to remain clear. ROAD TO PEACE hustled along in steady pursuit through the backstretch, kept under a ride and gained position around
the turn, was set down driving five wide with a furlong left tor run, shortened the gap on COMPANY STORE but could not get to rival in time, drifted wider in
final stages and cleared second best. PARKLAND STRONG chased two wide through opening stages then shifted out wider upon entering the turn,
remained in pursuit racing widest through the lane and secured share. FOUR OF SWORDS was sent out of the gate and raced in early contention off the
top two leaders, flattened and lost position moving through the turn, kept under pressure three wide entering top stretch and offered no late rally. KINGS
HIGHWAY lacked early foot and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then angled out three wide under pressure and failed to move on.
BROTHER AARON vied for the early lead racing inside of the eventual winner, could not match strides with rival past the half mile marker then steadily
faded.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF BLENHEIM contested the pace outside SCHOLAR ATHLETE for six furlongs, began to edge away with the rider taking a peek back
approaching the stretch, drew clear through the furlong grounds, and had enough to hold on late. DRAGON BAY was never far back, had aim outside the
leaders in the three-path turning for home, rallied steadily and was inching closer to the winner in the final yards. SCHOLAR ATHLETE vied inside the
winner up the backstretch and around the far turn, fought on to upper stretch before weakening, and just saved the show on the rail. ZULU went along in the
second flight two wide to the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, shifted back out a bit and could not be fully set down in late traffic behind and between the
top three. MOROCCO saved ground unhurried to the stretch, moved out entering the final furlong and was going well outside the leaders too late.
CAMMACK stayed in range inside for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. HOLIDAY BONUS was toward the rear from the outset, came four wide off the
far turn and could not gain.

Footnotes
SCARTO slightly steadied at the start then hustled up and advanced to challenge CAT GONE QUICK for the early lead, vied into the turn then shook free
past the quarter pole, quickly widened to a clear advantage then kept on under steady pressure, came under vigorous urging as the lead shortened up in
late stages and just lasted. KHOZY MY BOY hustled along in steady pursuit and raced between foes in opening stages, stayed on with response around the
turn, entered top stretch three wide then shifted out wider under left handed pressure, was getting to the leader deep stretch and just missed. PRINCE
KHOZAN broke in at the start then hustled up the inside through early stages, remained in pursuit racing four wide in the final furlong and stayed on with
interest to gain share. CHINOMADITO was briefly restless in the gate, raced under steady urging through early stages, moved into upper stretch five wide,
gained position then finished evenly. CAT GONE QUICK briefly led the way then challenged by the eventual winner and vied for the early lead, continued to
match strides into the turn then failed top move on with SCARTO past the quarter pole then steadily weakened in the lane. PURECRAZIDUDE raced in
contention through early stages then flattened around the turn then offered no late rally. ANIMA D'OR lacked early kick and raced in the back, was put to a
drive along the inside around the turn but failed to move on.

Footnotes
ANDI'S KITTEN deferred to TINY TURBO going to the first turn, moved out to prompt the pace between horses entering the backstretch, took over after a
half-mile, moved inside drawing clear around the far turn, and was kept driving through the lane. ALWAYS LUCKY was in range from the start, had the
three-path on the far turn, and ran on willingly to best the others. PRINCESA CRYSTAL (GB) broke out in front of ANNIEGETYOURPISTOL and bumped
solidly with BAD HABIT, came off the rail midway on the far turn, went back inside for the drive and was up for the show. BIT COIN QUEEN was four wide
prompting the early pace, moved in three then two wide on the far turn, and faded in the lane. TINY TURBO showed the way in the two-path around the first
turn, moved to the rail and yielded to the eventual winner late on the backstretch, and steadily dropped back. ANNIEGETYOURPISTOL was shut off
between PRINCESA CRYSTAL and BAD HABIT at the start, and was outrun two wide. BAD HABIT bumped solidly with PRINCESA CRYSTAL at the start,
and was finished early inside.

Footnotes
MICAH'S GIRL briefly vied for the lead out of the gate then cleared on top, held firm around the turn, roused for more upper stretch, stayed sharp in
response and kept clear. BABY ICE raced in range along the rail through early going, saved ground around the turn then prompted along the inside entering
the lane, stayed inside, kept on with response and gained place. SALSA RITA raced between rivals and chased through early stages and around the turn,
remained in steady pursuit four to five wide through the lane and prevailed for a share. BEST TREBOL (DOM) briefly vied for the lead out of the gate then
failed to match strides but remained forwardly placed in pursuit for the leader, continued a bid under pressure through the turn and kept on to try and secure
a placing in stretch run then evened out in final stages. POCKET OF CANDY raced in early contention and chased four wide around the turn then came up
empty in the lane. SHALL RETURN raced in the back and wide through early stages, switched in a couple paths, entered top stretch five wide and offered
no late rally. FRECKLES KAN showed early interest then failed to sustain bid into the turn and had no late response.

PAY ANY PRICE dashed to the early lead inside, shook off FIG JELLY and BOA NOVA coming off the turn, and had just enough to hang on. MAI TY ONE
ON saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved to the two-path late, surged between horses and came up a bit short. FIG JELLY bumped with
HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE at the start, pressed the pace between horses into the turn, got shaken off in upper stretch, and kept on with good courage
closing the gap in the final stages. EXPLORATIONIST was well placed behind the battling threesome on the turn, had the three-path into the lane with a
clear shot, and gained gradually. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE bumped with FIG JELLY at the start, was outsprinted two wide to the top of the lane, moved out
to the five-path and closed some ground without threatening. BOA NOVA (IRE) chased the leaders three wide into the turn, drifted wider weakening at the
top of the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
ALLURSTRA raced in contention and tracked the top pair through the backstretch, picked up the pace and moved through the turn three to four wide, was
set down at head of the lane, advanced to match UNPUBLISHED for the lead leaving the furlong marker then drew clear under steady encouragement.
UNPUBLISHED vied for the lead racing outside of AWESOME ACTION, continued to match strides leaving the backstretch then shook free still unleashed
mid-turn, hustled up turning for home, challenged for the lead by ALLUSTRA leaving the furlong marker, battled back briefly on equal terms then had no kick
left in reserve for the final sixteenth. STARSHIP APOLLO raced in contention positioned between foes in the second flight moving by the half mile marker,
remained in pursuit between foes around the turn then stayed on two wide with response and cleared share. LEMNISCATE raced off the pace while
positioned six wide through the backstretch, stayed outside and showed response moving around the turn, kept under steady pressure in the lane and
needed more for late impact. HE IZ GONE raced in contention along the rail and tracked the top flight going by the half mile marker, sat patiently midway
through the turn then hustled up three wide turning for home, stayed under pressure through the lane but failed to move on. SAINT LARNED raced off the
pace along the Inside in early going, shifted out and raced six wide under pressure entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally. AWESOME ACTION vied
for the early lead racing inside of UNPUBLISHED, could not maintain equal terms with rival midway through the turn then tired in the drive.

CHARMAINE'S MIA chased two then three wide around the turn, rallied determinedly outside the leaders through the stretch and was up to nail HIDDEN
FACTS in the final strides. HIDDEN FACTS dueled for the lead inside KITTEN'S COWGIRL from the start, got the best of that rival edging away on the rail
near the 70-yard marker, but was nailed at the wire. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL contested the pace outside HIDDEN FACTS from the beginning, and yielded
grudgingly between horses in deep stretch. SEAN'S IDEA brushed the right side of the gate and brushed into MY FAVORITE GIFT to get off slowest, came
off the inside midway on the turn, moved farther out in the stretch and gained late. MY FAVORITE GIFT brushed with SEAN'S IDEA at the start, saved
ground outsprinted to the stretch, and made no headway. SPEED STAR chased three wide to the end of the turn, and tired. GRAY OWL broke outward at
the start, raced three wide and dropped back before reaching the stretch.

HEIR BALL gained a contending position out of the gate and continued forwardly placed off the top two leaders, hustled along three wide around the turn,
stayed under steady pressure and advanced to race in striking distance with a furlong left to run, continued to inch up closer on BAND OF ANGELS in late
stages and edged away under a driving finish. BAND OF ANGELS was off to a good start and held a slim lead in opening stages then began to duel for the
lead racing inside of HIGH JINGO, dug in and shook free to a slim lead turning for home, battled on with a narrow advantage then got wore down by HEIR
BALL in final stages. HIGH JINGO prompted out of the gate and advanced to challenge BAND OF ANGELS for the early lead, battled with rival around the
turn, could not remain on equal terms but stayed up close in aim with a furlong left to run, got collared for position by eventual winner and began to flatten
then steadied deep stretch. FANCY FOX raced in range through early stages then hustled up three wide around the turn, kept on under firm handling
through the lane and finished with response. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN was never too far off the early pace, saved ground and prompted along the rail around
the turn then shifted out at head of the lane, continued a steady bid along the outside but needed more for late impact. BAHAMA KITTEN raced off the early
pace, dropped to the inside late backstretch and saved ground through the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and failed to rally under pressure. DIXIE
PRINCESS raced off the early speed, was under a drive racing five wide entering top stretch and failed to kick on. MAJESTIC MAIARA was off slow at the
start, trailed in the back then raced wide into stretch and failed to offer a threatening bid. CHRISTMAS MAGIC raced up close in early going then faded
around the turn and had no late response.
