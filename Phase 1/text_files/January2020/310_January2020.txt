three wide around the turn, was no match for the top two, but held on for third. STORM CLASSIC bumped both sides, raced within contention and was
outfinished for the show position. CHROME FIRE void of early speed and was never a threat. GOODROCKINALVIN raced near the back, lacked a bid and
was outrun.

clear third. PREEMPTIVE pressed the early pace and faded. LUCKY TAYLOR threw head at the break, raced within contention and was finished early.

TWO MIKES N DOC G unhurried in the early going, moved up, racing four wide down the backside, came around the turn on the outside, rallied down the
stretch and drove clear. DUE APEAL raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn four wide, finished willingly and was a clear second.
INTIMIDATING challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. HOT TEN went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail
and weakened down the lane. STANTON C raced within striking distance, came around the final turn between rivals and finished evenly. ACTIF ONE raced
in the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. SIMBA'S PRIDE raced in the back of the pack, came around the second turn wide, moved up,
but was no factor. RAISE EM UP lacked early speed and was never close. HALO REDDING pressed the early pace and was finished early. FAMILIAR
RHYTHM raced near the front in the beginning and retreated to the back.

Footnotes
JUST STORMIN vied for the early lead, took the advantage around the final turn, dueled to the wire with BISTRAYA and proved the best late. BISTRAYA
pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of rest. MAGA MAN raced within
contention, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. JIMI'S A STAR lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a mild
bid, racing four wide, but was no factor. PRIZELESS went to the front, opened up, saved ground and faded. GALAXY BUILDER raced evenly near the back
and was never a threat. TAKEN BACK got away slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VICTORY BIND dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. SPEEDACTUS raced in the middle
of the pack, came around the second turn on the outside, rallied down the lane and was a clear second at the wire. SIX GRAND went to the front, forwardly
placed throughout and lacked a late kick. MANGELSEN raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn, and finished evenly. SIDNEY'S
HUNCH lacked early speed, made a late gain, but was no factor. TEN GRAND raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
SUPERCONDUCTOR pressed the early pace and faded. GENUIDE steadied early, getting in tight quarters and was never a threat. RELENTLESS
ATTACK always raced near the back and was outrun.
