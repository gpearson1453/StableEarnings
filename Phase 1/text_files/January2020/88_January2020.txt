Footnotes
LUCILLE was outsprinted to the backstretch then moved up to engage for the lead leaving the five eighths, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, edged
away to mid stretch then held under steady urging. BOLD ANTE had the best speed early, was overtaken by the winner leaving the five eighths, pressed
that one from the rail to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task, rallied but was too late. MOON ROCKET stalked the pace to the
backstretch, briefly dueled the top two then was chasing two or three wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SURE
MAGIC trailed to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and also failed to offer a late response while not switching leads in the drive. MY IDOL
was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the lane. WHY ARE U SO SWEET saved
ground to no avail.

Footnotes
DRAW ME had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded when set down and held driving. GOING TO SHABOOMS pressed
the winner two wide to the stretch then could not catch that one while besting the others. VERY BOISTEROUS was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to
the stretch but lacked a closing response. RAELEE was also chasing inside of VERY BOISTEROUS, shifted off the rail mid turn then finished evenly and
just missed the show. POPULAR APPEAL had no speed, got fanned four wide on the turn, briefly looked a factor to mid stretch then slackened. LADY
SUNSET broke in a tangle, had no speed and was outrun.

HOT N'FAMOUS tracked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, took over in mid stretch, was clear late and held off the fast closing HOT'N
NOTTY. The latter was outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then closed with a rush but was too late. POWER TIMES TWO pressed the
winner two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. OUR TIGER'S BOY hustled to the lead, set the pace from the
rail to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch and finished evenly. BILL'S HAPPY HOUR tracked the pace early, was two wide to the stretch
then could not offer the needed late response. CANDY CREW got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and also lacked a late bid.
TANNER'S MY NAME had no speed, shifted off the rail mid turn but could not make an impact in the drive. ROMAN ROCKET broke slow, had no speed
and showed little.

Footnotes
SPUN AWAY was outsprinted to the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied when set down, caught TONI TWO POCKET in mid stretch and
surged clear under steady urging. TONI TWO POCKET set the pace two wide to the stretch, was caught leaving mid stretch and finished evenly for the
place. GO VAIDAGIRL had no speed, raced off the rail on the turn then could only pick off rivals in the drive while not threatening the top two. AUTISM'S
QUEST tracked the leader two then three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. PATSY CLINE chased the pace to the turn then
was forced out four wide to the stretch and gave way in the drive. FIRSTCLASSTOPARIS also was chasing the favorite three wide to the stretch then
weakened. MUSKETIER WALTZ had no speed and was always outrun. CHIEFTESS pressed the pace to the turn, stopped after a half mile then was eased
in mid stretch but walked off.
