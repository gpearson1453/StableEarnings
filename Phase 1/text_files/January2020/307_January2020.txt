Footnotes
TRICKIZAR good position to turn, split horses into stretch and ran away late in good fashion. SHEESA PONTIAC with the pace throughout, no match for
winner, held place. FACTRESS raced evenly well off rail throughout, no late kick in the drive. TSCHUDI'S GIRL broke outwards start, raced a wide trip lost
all the ground. WAR EAGLE'S LOVE raced evenly while saving ground throughout to no avail. CLASSY SCARLETT no speed to the turn, improved position
only. PULLED THE GOALIE broke in a tangle, never menaced thereafter. LIVELY SPELL off a bit tardy, rushed like a rocket inside to the lead, used up.
PAIGE'S STAR brief foot outside, gave way readily. LIL POM POM never a menace. GATO STYLE dropped back readily at the half. AT LEAST always
trailed.

LINER just off leaders three wide to the lead turn, clear, held sway. PROMISED FAME never far back to far turn, fought gamely in the final furlong. SOCIAL
CIRCLE unhurried to far turn, swept three-four wide, flattened out late. HOOSIER GOLD CASE raced evenly with no late run when needed in the stretch.
KELLY'S AGENDA unhurried early, rallied far turn while mildly in the drive. VIVA PER LEI never a factor. NARROWS BRIDGE good inside speed to the
half, gave way readily. HONEY SHACK pressed pace to the half, gave way.
