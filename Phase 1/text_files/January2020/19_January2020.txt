Footnotes
MY ONLY SUNSHINE pressed the early leader from along the rail, fell back entering the turn, came out into the two path when put to whip midway on the
bend, closed a gap from the outside through the final yards and was up on the nod. VICTORIOUS BEAR opened a short lead soon after the break, moved
clear from outside the winner into the turn, angled to the inside, remained clear into deep stretch but couldn't last. PAINTED CLOWN steadied in tight along
the rail entering the turn, remained along the rail once clear, was even inside the winner entering the final furlong but couldn't stay with that one. BAYSIDER
raced three wide around the turn, had position outside the winner into the final furlong but lacked the needed closing. ALWAYS FREE came out into the
three path on the turn while trailing and failed to menace. SPARE KEY broke slowly and failed to matter.

Footnotes
JUST DO THE MATH set the pace inside of a rival, angled from the three to the two path into the turn, cleared away from his pressing foe passing the five
sixteenths pole, then held sway through the lane under driving pressure. JUMP SHOT chased the pace from along the inside, failed to keep pace with the
leader approaching the quarter pole, but willingly prevailed over SKY GAZER R V F for place. SKY GAZER R V F pressed the pace setter while in the four
to three path into the turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival passing the five sixteenths pole, then kept on though the stretch while hanging on his left
lead. GIO LUCKY stalked three wide, but lacked a kick in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly for a minor reward. REY ASTRAY stalked from midpack while
two wide and between horses, but lacked a kick in upper stretch and weakened. SOUTHAMPTON PRIDE was outrun from the start, took the turn in the four
path while inside of a rival, and failed to get involved. FIREINTHEPULPIT was outrun, trailed outside of a rival while being kept in the five path around the
turn, and never got involved.

HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME vied inside the early leader into the stretch and drove clear just before a mile. UNCLE ARCHIE took command at once, stayed
out from the rail, held onto a small lead under urging into the final furlong then weakened. TOP HAT WARRIOR raced three wide around both turns and
gained the show from between horses. BABY BREZ chased in the three path outside the early leader then tired. SILENT ALARM stayed close to the inside
and failed to menace. HOLY SNIP trailed to the stretch while no factor. NIGHT SPREE wasn't far back between horses around the first turn then stopped. A
dense fog obscured vision.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN TOUCH set the pace while outside of a rival, cleared off from that foe into the far turn, drew further away in upper stretch while drifting
outwards, and sealed the deal under driving pressure. JERSEY RICH stalked along the inside, shifted off the rail into the far turn, commenced a rally in the
three path turning for home, but was outkicked by the leader in upper stretch, shifted to the five path, and was second best. HEAVY TIPPER trailed along
the inside, shifted to the three path into the far turn, angled to the rail at the furlong pole to make a bid for minor rewards inside of foes, and offered a mild
rally. GFOUR settled far off the pace two wide, commenced a mild rally in the five path around the far turn, but failed to threaten and got outfinished for
minor rewards while hanging on her left lead. MARNESIA BIG GIRL pressed the pace along the rail, but came under coaxing to keep pace into the far turn,
failed to do so, then weakened for minor rewards in the final furlong. ROMAN REIGN stalked three to four wide, but weakened approaching the quarter pole.
YOURCREDITISGOOD stalked two to three wide while between horses, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. LIDDYUP failed to keep pace with the
field down the backstretch, trailed by a large distance into the far turn, and struggled to finish, but walked off. A dense fog obscured the track.

OH BABY BABY began a run five wide into the turn, reached the front nearing the stretch, drew out approaching the furlong grounds then bore out late
under steady left hand whip. BRIDGE TO BROOKLYN was prominent along the rail from the outset, fell off the pace entering the turn, angled out on the
bend, ducked out sharply under left hand whip past midstretch and gained slowly to the end. ZIPPY JO dueled three wide between rivals to the stretch then
weakened. ROMAN BELLA showed speed two wide between rivals into the turn then tired in the lane. SWEET MAGIC MOMENT broke sharply, was taken
in hand soon after, trailed into the stretch and failed to menace. MAKEMEASAMMICH was between rivals with the pace into the turn, bore out then stopped.

Footnotes
VENUS RAMEY set a pressured pace inside of a rival while staying in the two path, shook loose from the field in the three path turning for home, then held
sway under driving pressure. PARANOIA stalked along the inside, attempted a rail bid for the lead in upper stretch, shifted off the fence to the two path
inside the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch the leader. ROLL ON BIG MAMA was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, shifted to the
four path to be outside of the leaders turning for home, and rallied mildly for minor rewards without threatening the leader. CHARITY STRIPE pressed the
pace setter while being kept in the three path, inched closer to make a bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, then weakened and got outfinished for minor rewards. MILE END settled three wide in midpack, came under coaxing into the turn, angled inwards to
save ground approaching the quarter pole, but lacked a rally through the lane. HUSH BUFFY saved ground around the turn while trailing, then passed tired
outer foes in upper stretch without threatening. LITTLE CHERIE was outrun two wide, drifted to the seven path at the quarter pole, and never got involved.
SHARPIN prompted the pace four to three wide, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole, then stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
JASPER K prompted the pace along the inside before making a bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, dueled inside a pair of rivals around the far turn,
inched a slight lead in upper stretch, then held it gamely to the wire. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN settled four wide in midpack, inched forward and bid for the
lead into the far turn, dueled outside of a pair of foes around that bend, sustained the duel into the lane, but failed to kick away inside the final furlong, hung
and was bested. EYES OF ZEUS split foes around the first turn to establish a clear lead into the backstretch, stayed off the rail and met challenges from
rivals on both sides into the far turn, dueled between those foes around the bend, but was headed at the quarter pole and gave way appraoching the furlong
marker. JUST FOR ROSE was void of early speed while four to three wide around the first turn, came under coaxing into the backstretch, drifted to the six
path at the half mild pole, came under encouragement from the whip into the far turn, causing him to drift to the rail, then stayed on mildly through the lane.
KISS THE SPIDER raced in midpack inside of a rival while staying off the rail, tracked the trio of leaders into the lane, but lacked a rally in upper stretch and
weakened passing the furlong pole. SPORTING ART was crowded early on, took back and trailed the field, and was never involved. VERONAS VICTOR
was caught in the five to six path around the first turn, tucked in and saved ground around the far turn, but failed to make an impact. WILDCAT CURA
showed good early speed three wide around the first turn, but weakened passing the five furlong pole, steadied slightly while fading between horses at the
seven sixteenths pole, then stopped.
