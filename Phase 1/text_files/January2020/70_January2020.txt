Footnotes
JOYOUS TIMES raced three to four wide entering the first turn, advanced to apply pressure to I'LL DO IT MY WAY in early backstretch, continued to force
the issue to the far turn then vied for the lead and shook clear at head of the lane, continued to dig in under steady pressure and had just enough in reserve
to hold on. COUPLE OF NIKKIS stalked the top two leaders down the backstretch, prompted three to four wide leaving the far turn then moved out wider
under left handed pressure, closed the gap on the winner deep stretch and got nipped for the win. CHEROKEE SOUND angled in and saved ground around
the first turn, settled while rated off the early pace then picked up the tempo late backstretch, was under a drive near the inside at the quarter pole then
swung to the outside turning for home, remained in pursuit along the far outside, was edging up approaching the wire and just missed. DAYS OF SPRING
was allowed to settle while positioned four to five wide through the backstretch, launched a bid and gained position around the far turn, raced in striking
range with a furlong left to run then lacked the closing kick to move by. LOOKN FINE AS WINE raced near midpack while rated through early stages,
hustled up late backstretch and kept under pressure entering the far turn, waited briefly between foes near the quarter pole then continued a steady bid but
needed more for late impact. SILVER PALMS settled near midpack and saved ground down the backstretch, launched a bid along the inside and gained
position around the far turn, switched out three wide at head of the lane then gave way. AMBER PRINCESS raced off the early pace, saved ground and
prompted along the rail in the far turn, stayed near the inside under pressure in stretch run and lacked a needed rally. I'LL DO IT MY WAY set a pressured
pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead with the eventual winner around the final turn then tired in the drive. MINEWELLRECEIVED raced off the pace
while positioned just off the inside down the backstretch, prompted two wide entering the far turn and had no response. OCEAN ECHO hesitated and came
away slowly at the start, raced in the back and had no response when called upon. C EST FAST vied for the lead around the first turn then remained up
close just off the leader in early backstretch then failed to keep pace and retreated after the half.

DISTINCTIVE LADY tracked behind the leaders inside, tipped out to take a run at SUZ from the outside turning for home, fought shoulder to shoulder
through most of the final furlong and was up near the wire. SUZ rated along on a short lead for three furlongs, responded when set down in upper stretch,
battled on gamely to the finish and just missed. SAME KINDA CRAZY swung four wide approaching the stretch, but could not keep pace with the top two.
ASSAIL pressed the pace three wide, put in a mild bid near the quarter-pole, but gave way in the lane. RATTLESNAKEROSE pressed the early pace
between horses, and dropped back around the turn.

RIGHT ON was off to a good start and settled nicely tracking top two leaders through early stages, let out a notch and advanced three wide to engage the
top pair for the lead at the quarter pole, cleared the advantage then drifted five wide turning for home, switched in a couple paths under right handed
pressure and stayed sharp. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA raced in a forward position along the inside through the backstretch, hustled along but lost position
around the turn, remained in steady pursuit along the inside in the drive, gained and secured second best. SUSIKIN was under slight restraint while vying for
the lead in opening stages, continued to match strides into the turn then failed to be a match when the winner took over past the quarter pole, stayed on with
interest and edged out foe for share. A SONG FOR SUE hustled along and raced in the last flight at the half mile marker, chased two wide around the turn
then moved out wider in the drive then finished evenly and got edged out for show. HOW SWEEP IT IS bobbled at the start and quickly recovered to
challenge for the lead, vied inside of SUSIKEN into the turn, failed to be a match when the winner took command past the quarter pole then gave way in the
lane. GOSSIP ISLE raced along the outside and in the last flight going by the half mile marker, raced wide into upper stretch and failed to move on.

Footnotes
HEY KITTEN bobbled slightly a few strides away from the gate, but to no ill effect, went along unhurried between horses through the middle stages, moved
out three wide to take over at the top of the stretch, drew well clear driven through the furlong grounds and was hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile.
OMNIA pressed the early, pace, lodged a bid between horses late on the far turn, proved no match for the winner turning for home but ran on best of the
others. BETTER WITH AGE was far back early and trailed for six furlongs, moved off the inside approaching the stretch, and rallied belatedly. LOVE
RANGER appeared well placed inside and under a snug hold early, but did not have enough when roused in the two-path coming off the far turn.
HARMONIC THUNDER stayed close early three wide, came under a ride around the far turn, but made no impact and faded in the lane. SPECIAL LIAISON
hit the left side of the gate and was off slowly, entered the backstretch in the four-path, and could not reach contention. UNEXPLAINABLE set the pace
inside for six furlongs, and gave way once displaced by the first two finishers into the stretch.

Footnotes
ANIMAL TRICK dropped over to the inside in opening stages and advanced to challenge SMOKE 'N' GREAT for the early lead, continued to duel with rival
around the turn, battled back gamely racing inside a duo through the stretch run, gained a slim advantage in final stages and dug in determinedly to prevail.
SMOKE 'N' GLOAT held a slim lead in opening stages then dueled for the top spot racing outside of ANIMAL TRICK, dueled around the turn holding a slight
edge, turned for home two wide and continued to dig in racing between foes in final stages then lacked a final kick to get by. DR HARLAN raced under a
snug hold to rate off the early leaders, let out moving through the turn and advanced to engage the top pair leaving the quarter pole, dueled three wide into
stretch run, continued in aim but yielded in final stages. DOC KANE shifted to the outside in opening stages, raced five to six wide off the early pace, circled
up closer racing five wide nearing the quarter pole then flattened along the outside upper stretch. ART'S TABLE was not far back at the half and hustled up
racing four wide entering the turn, prompted but failed to advance position around the turn, stayed under pressure near the inside in stretch run and failed to
move on. DIAMOND MAJESTY hustled along in steady pursuit of the early leaders, continued a bid racing in range into the turn then failed to sustain bid out
of the turn and steadily weakened. AKTABANTAY (GB) was off to a good start and showed early response but could not sustain bid and retreated in the
turn.

Footnotes
NILESTAR broke alertly and pressed the pace outside SHANGHAI BONNIE, took over in the three-path leaving the turn and drew clear under a mild drive.
MOON EYES was never far back, slipped through on the rail to loom a threat into the stretch, could not reach the winner but bested the others. AVOCADO
TOAST was outrun for three furlongs, angled six wide into the lane and rallied with good energy. SHANGHAI BONNIE dashed to the front after the start,
showed the way to the top of the stretch a bit off the inside, and weakened. MISS CHLOE G turned in an even effort while saving ground. SKY RUN raced
just off the first flight between horses heading to the turn in the two-path, and lacked the needed response. LITTLE NICOLE got shuffled back along the rail
approaching the turn, and could not reach contention. BLUE EYED BETH raced four then five wide around the turn, and faded steadily. SHANGHAI
MISTRESS tired three wide after three-eighths of a mile. EASTERN PRINCESS was jostled around a bit between SHANGHAI MISTRESS and BLUE EYED
BETH early, and made no impact.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RO was off in opening stages to challenge for the early lead and vied between rivals approaching at the half mile marker, got by inside running
AMERICAN ROCK SALT and took the inside position while vying for the lead with VERY AMUSING through the turn, continued to battle back and took a
slight edge in late stages, dug in under right handed pressure and held safe in final strides. VERY AMUSING vied three wide for the early lead then got by
one foe while staying on equal terms with ELUSIVE RO around the turn, turned for home two wide, continued to battle for the late lead, kept on with game
response but lacked the closing kick to get by the winner. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER was a step slow after breaking from the gate and dropped inside to save
ground, quickly picked up the pace and advanced up the inside then switched out three wide around the turn, remained three wide in steady pursuit for the
top pair in the lane and finished clear for share. SIGHTED raced four wide off the top trio going by the half mile marker, hustled up along the outside around
the turn then flattened out in the lane. FULGENCIO raced off the early speed and moved in to race two wide leaving the backstretch, raced under steady
pressure but failed to move on around the turn and offered no late rally. AMERICAN ROCK SALT vied for the early lead racing along the inside then
steadied while fading around the turn. LAWYER DRILL raced five wide off the early pace then moved into stretch five wide and failed to move into
contention.

Footnotes
CODRINGTON saved ground covered up behind the leaders for six furlongs, waited briefly for a clear lane turning for home, responded readily to get
through an opening on the rail in upper stretch, and edged clear under hand urging. TOOTSIE raced in the second flight two wide to the far turn, shifted to
the four-path nearing the stretch and closed steadily outside horses. BLAME THE GODS prompted the pace outside FEATURE CREATURE from the start,
challenged into the stretch, but was outkicked in the final furlong. FAIRY LINK hugged the rail outrun to the stretch, stayed inside and offered a mild
response to earn a share. FEATURE CREATURE showed the way through even fractions for six furlongs, then yielded to pressure from both flanks in deep
stretch. TAKE CHARGE TINA went along forwardly placed three wide from the outset, found herself boxed in through the stretch and could never be fully
set down. TIPLE (IRE) settled in midpack early, moved menacingly three then four wide approaching the quarter-pole, but flattened out through the furlong
grounds. TIZZIRE steadied slightly after the start, spent much of the trip in the three-path, came four wide into the lane and could not gain while lugging in to
wind up on the fence.
