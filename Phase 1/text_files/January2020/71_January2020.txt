Footnotes
STERLING CANYON settled close three wide then started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep rounding the far turn and
dug in determinedly to take the nod and edge clear later yards. CRYPTOSONDE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn four wide then dug in to take second the final strides. W V ROCKET MAN stalked the pace two deep and took the lead at the three
eighths pole, contested even terms at the rail rounding the far turn and continued gamely to late stretch before flattening stride. BROTHER DAN settled
close toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened out the final furlong. BRUTUS BRAE settled close
off the rail, bid toward the three eighths pole, steadied between horses in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and
showed little more. MICHAEL CONNOR became a bit edgy in the gate and set the early pace inside, ceded control at the three eighths pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and weakened. GLOBAL FIRST CLASS raced off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn and raced outside into the
backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide and showed little more. LOVIE'S BITER loped along and showed little
response in the stretch.

Footnotes
FASTER THAN CHROME gave chase well off the rail and dueled close while five wide on the turn, then dug in leaving the turn to get up and edge clear
late. MERGER OF BANKS gave chase off the rail and rounded the turn about the three path then dueled through the stretch to take second the final yards.
LUCKY LEONARD chased the pace outside and raced in the six path of the turn, then dug in through the stretch but was outfinished in a later duel for
second. BOOTSIE BOY engaged in close chase and raced three wide on the turn then continued a factor to late stretch before flattening stride. ROCK ON
chased the pace through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage while two deep and between horses on the turn, took a slim lead
mid-stretch then flattened stride later yards. FORBIDDEN TOPIC raced well back from early contention, rounded the turn in the five path and could only
improve his position. STALWART HUMOR set a pressured pace through the backstretch, contested the edge at the rail rounding the turn, gave up the
advantage in the upper stretch then weakened the final sixteenth. ORIOLES MAGIC gave chase inside, appeared to hit the rail nearing the quarter pole then
faded at the rail rounding the turn. WINDSOR CALLING chased the pace and raced close at the rail through the turn, but, steadied mid-stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
SWING BATTER gave chase toward the outside and took over leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced clear midway on the turn then kept alert down the
lane. WHALE OF A RIDE contested at even terms through the backstretch then ducked in to make sharp contact with Marleesbeebee leaving the five
sixteenths pole while at the same time gave the lead to the winner and had to settle for second best. BARN YARD BRAT gave chase outside and raced in
range of the lead in the four path of the turn, but showed little further in the lane. SONDE ST BLUES gave chase well off the rail, rounded the turn about the
three path then finished evenly. TWEET THIS gave chase inside then flattened the final furlong. MY GUY ELI raced well back before passing some faders.
BULL MEECHUM was never a factor. DEPUTY ROCKET came away a step slow and was slow getting into stride. MARLEESBEEBEE pressured Whale Of
A Ride through the backstretch but was bumped off stride by that one leaving the five sixteenths pole and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
CRAIG'S settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three wide, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and drew clear
later yards. MORNING MUSE settled off the pace and off the rail, dueled to the lead past the three eighths pole, raced clear toward the quarter, dug in to
steady encouragement leaving the far turn but was caught later yards while able to maintain second. PRAISE THE MOON set the early pace inside but was
met at even terms and gave up the lead midway on the first turn, gave chase through the backstretch, dueled the winner through most of the backstretch but
dropped back toward the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, steadied off the heels of Morning Muse mid-stretch but altered course from there and
held on for third. SOUTHERN BARBECUE saved ground into the opening turn and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly. CRAZED settled back off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced well back saving early ground, improved his position off the rail rounding the
far turn, then angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished evenly. GLEN'S CASTLE raced in the five path the opening turn, left the turn outside
and showed little response through the backstretch. MIGHTY BOP was outrun. CHARITABLE MARK raced outside into the backstretch and showed little
response. STAR HAWK took the lead two deep past the five eighths pole but was caught leaving the three eighths and faded readily at the rail.

Footnotes
DEREKA'S BLUFF settled off the early pace toward the outside then angled in to contest the turn two deep, took the lead approaching the top of the lane,
dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well with steady handling. CLUBIN TILL DAWN chased the pace and raced off the rail rounding the turn then dug in for
second inside the sixteenth pole, and finished well. U S FUNDS chased the pace toward the inside then eased to the eight path through the turn, drifted
wider still leaving the turn and was along for third in the final yards. NATURAL SONDE gave chase off the rail and raced hemmed in past the five sixteenths
pole then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. ELAINE set a pressured pace from the seven sixteenths pole, contested the rail through the turn then
weakened toward mid-stretch. MEET MS BOBBI RAE saved ground and could only improve her position. HAPPY FREEDOM gave chase outside, raced in
the five path of the turn and showed little more. BECOMING MACHEN gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and had little
left. MIGHTY CROSSING gave chase about the four path then weakened.

Footnotes
MORGAN COUNTY stalked the pace then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from the mid point of the far turn, drew clear
mid-stretch then widened later yards. RIGHTEOUS MAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, dug in
to take second later yards and just lasted. AFFIX saved ground off the early pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to the five path rounding the
far turn, finished well and was gaining on the runner-up. SIENTE EL VIENTO rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths then settled close into the
backstretch, bid toward the three eighths, raced in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. ZEP angled to the inside to rate the
pace, was pressured toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail rounding the far turn, dug in at even terms with Morgan County from the
mid point of the far turn and stayed on well to mid-stretch before giving way. MOLOKAI settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn then bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, but, proved empty down the lane. TRUE HEIR settled off the pace inside then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
though, faded in the five path of the far turn. TURNER ASHBY raced well off the pace about the four path the opening turn and showed little response down
the backstretch. COCONUT MAN steadied off the heels of Turner Ashby into the first turn, raced outside entering the backstretch and was of little
consequence.

Footnotes
NEKIA'S FIRST LADY stalked the pace two deep the first turn then challenged at even terms past the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving the five
sixteenths and contested a slim lead two deep on the far turn, drifted a bit in the upper stretch but dug in to recover clear territory later yards. ULTIMATE
JUSTICE raced off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, appeared a close factor mid-stretch and dug in from
there to earn second. OWNER'S SUITE ducked in across the path of Over The Hillary leaving the gate then angled to the inside to set the pace, was met at
even terms past the seven sixteenths pole and ceded the nod beyond the five sixteenths, dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn then
outfinished in a later duel for second. DEVILISH BEAUTY stalked the pace from the three path then bid nearing the three eighths pole, stayed in range of
the lead still in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. OVER THE HILLARY was pinched back at the start and swung to the five path into the first
turn, raced outside entering the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole then flattened out five wide on the far turn. WILD CAPPUCINO stalked the
earlier pace inside then faded past the three eighths pole. Following a claim of foul against the rider of Owner's Suite, lodged by the rider of Over The
Hillary, the stewards disqualified the former to fifth place for veering across the path of the latter leaving the gate.
