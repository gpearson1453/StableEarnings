# Stable Earnings

The objective of the Stable Earnings project is to develop an advanced system that generates betting recommendations for horse racing by using historical race data. This project utilizes publicly available past performance charts, sourced from Equibase, to compile comprehensive statistical profiles for each horse that has raced in the United States since January 2020.

These horse profiles are created by extracting and analyzing detailed race results, encompassing various performance metrics. The data is then used to train a neural network designed to project odds for future races. The neural network learns from the historical profiles and their respective outcomes to produce predictions about the likelihood of each horse's performance in future races.

Betting recommendations are generated by identifying discrepancies between the projected odds from the neural network and the actual odds available in the paramutual betting market. When these discrepancies reveal opportunities for wagers with a positive expected return, the program suggests which bets to place, aiming to improve the betting outcomes through statistical analysis and machine learning predictions.

## Phase 1
Phase 1 of the Stable Earnings project involves downloading all relevant files from Equibase, which are provided in PDF format. These files are reformatted by numbering the PDFs and creating corresponding files to hold their extracted text. The extracted text is then analyzed to retrieve all relevant information, including race results and horse profiles. This data is consolidated into a comprehensive CSV file, which will serve as the foundation for further analysis in the project.
